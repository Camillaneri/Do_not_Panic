<p>Who was the <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">worst novelist in history</span>? A definitive answer is probably impossible, given that <span id="C_" class="mention concept" about="artistic failure" data-label="_">total artistic failure</span> traditionally results in <span id="C3" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="obscurity">total obscurity</span>. But it would be foolish to even consider the question without taking into account a very notable exception to that rule—a schoolmistress from <span id="L1" class="mention place" about="Northern Ireland" data-label="Northern Ireland" data-wikidata-id="Q26">Northern Ireland</span> whose novels were so uniquely and thrillingly terrible that, in the <span id="D1" class="mention date" about="timePeriod" data-label="early years of 1900">early years of the last century</span>, she became an <span id="C3" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">ironic cause célèbre</span> among the cultural luminaries of her time. Her story gives us some perspective on what we tend to think of as a uniquely contemporary phenomenon: <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">the ironic appreciation</span> of bad art—of monkey-faced <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="ArtTecnique" data-label="Fresco">frescos</span> and multichapter <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="MusicGenre" data-label="Rhythm and blues">R&B</span> melodramas. This <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal">terrible novelist</span> was a sort of <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">early avatar of the spirit of the Epic Fail</span>.</p>


<p>She was born <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Anna McKittrick</span> in the <span id="L2" class="mention place" about="Drumaness" data-label="Drumaness" data-wikidata-id="Q84101">village of Drumaness</span> in <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="1860" data-label="1860">1860</span> and became <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Anna Ross</span> when, after taking up a teaching position in Larne, she married the town’s stationmaster, <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="AndrewRoss" data-label="Andrew Ross">Andrew Ross</span>. When she began to write novels, she did so under the pseudonym <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Amanda McKittrick Ros</span>, taking the name Amanda from an Irish romantic novel and dropping the second S in her husband’s surname in order to imply a connection with the noble de Ros family of County Down. For their 10th wedding anniversary, she convinced <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="AndrewRoss" data-label="Andrew Ross">Andrew</span> to put up the cash to have her first novel, <span id="C_" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span>, printed in <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Dublin" data-label="Dublin" data-wikidata-id="Q1761">Dublin</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">The novel</span> isn’t, in any conventional sense, a page-turner. Over 189 pages, <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Plot summary">Irene Iddesleigh tells the story of a young Canterbury lady who marries an older man, realizes she doesn’t love him, and then elopes to America with her tutor. The tutor in question, Oscar Otwell, turns out to be a total boozehound and gets sacked for being oiled up on the job. That night, he comes home drunk and either rapes Irene or just says a lot of horrible things to her. (<span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Autor Note">It’s not clear from <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ narration, which is nominally omniscient but still frequently leaves the reader unenlightened</span>.) He then drowns himself, and Irene decides to cut her losses and return to England</span>. At least, I think that’s what happens; <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Autor Note">I wouldn’t want to fully commit to that interpretation. But it hardly matters either way. It isn’t for their plots that people read Ros’ novels. <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">They read them for their rigorously terrible sentences and for the masochistic pleasures of translating them into something like sense</span>.</p>

<p>In a way, Ros’ prose amounts to a sort of <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">accidental <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryMovement" data-label="surrealism">surrealism</span></span>. There is an intention toward metaphor—a lunge in the general direction of the literary—but an obvious misunderstanding of how such things work (and often, for that matter, how syntax works). One of the more illuminating pieces of criticism on Ros’ work is <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="AldousHuxley" data-label="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</span>’s essay “<span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Euphues Redivivus">Euphues Redivivus</span>,” which he published in his collection On the Margin in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="1923" data-label="1923">1923</span>. Here, he discusses her prose style in relation to <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryStyle" data-label="Euphuism">Euphuism</span>, a form of writing that takes its name from <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="JohnLyly" data-label="John Lyly">John Lyly</span>’s elaborately mannered <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="1578" data-label="1578">1578</span> didactic romance <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Euphues: The Anatomy of Wyt">Euphues: The Anatomy of Wyt</span>. <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="AldousHuxley" data-label="Aldous Huxley">Huxley</span> acknowledges the extreme unlikelihood of <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> ever having read <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="JohnLyly" data-label="John Lyly">Lyly</span> but is nonetheless struck by the strange resemblance in their approaches to language. “<span CITATION>In <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Mrs. Ros</span></span>,” he writes, “<span CITATION>we see, as we see in the <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryMovement" data-label="Elizabethan Literature">Elizabethan novelists</span>, the result of the discovery of art by an unsophisticated mind and of its first conscious attempt to produce the artistic. It is remarkable how late in the history of every literature simplicity is invented. The first attempts of any people to be consciously literary are always productive of the most elaborate artificiality</span>.” (<span id="P6" class="mention person" about="SusanSontag" data-label="Susan Sontag">Susan Sontag</span>’s “<span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="_">Notes on Camp</span>” identifies Euphuism as an early forerunner of Camp culture. “<span CITATION>All Camp objects, and persons</span>,” as she puts it, “<span CITATION>contain a large element of artifice</span>.”)</p>

<p>One thing that is clear about <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ prose is its aversion to calling a thing by its name. Eyes are “<span CITATION>globes of glare</span>.” When their owners are unhappy, these globes are “<span CITATION>stuffed with sorrow</span>.” Trousers are not trousers; they are “<span CITATION>the southern necessary</span>.” It’s as if, for <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>, circumlocution and literature are essentially synonymous. <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Plot summary">When a near-destitute Oscar is forced to take up work as a schoolteacher in <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="United States of America" data-label="United States of America" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span>, he is quickly “<span CITATION>compelled to resign through courting too great love for the all-powerful monster of mangled might</span>”</span>—by which she means, naturally, “Intemperance.” And then <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Plot summary">there’s this extraordinary sentence about the eponymous heroine of her second novel, Delina Delaney: “<span CITATION>She tried hard to keep herself a stranger to her poor old father’s slight income by the use of the finest production of steel, whose blunt edge eyed the reely covering with marked greed, and offered its sharp dart to faultless fabrics of flaxen fineness</span>.” (That is, Delina did some work as a seamstress so she wouldn’t have to live off her father.)</span> <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Plot summary">Near the end of <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span>, <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> contrives to have her heroine bump into Lord Dilworth, her adoptive father, at the harbor where she is about to get on the boat home from New York. She tells him about the grim situation she’s found herself in (what with Oscar’s waywardness unto death), but, “<span CITATION>misery having likewise carpeted Lord Dilworth’s floors of fate so much of late, he consequently [does] not seem so astonished as imagined</span>.”</span></p>

<p>This stuff is, in lowish doses, quite entertaining, but if you read enough of it, its absurdity seems to spread outward to the whole of literature, like a particularly contagious airborne virus. Read a few chapters of one of her books and then pick up a book by, say, <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="MarilynneRobinson" data-label="Marilynne Robinson">Marilynne Robinson</span> (<span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="literal">one of contemporary literature’s truly great prose stylists</span>), and even <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="MarilynneRobinson" data-label="Marilynne Robinson">Robinson</span>’s flawless sentences start to seem slightly contrived. <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal"><span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ writing is not just bad, in other words; its badness is so potent that it seems to undermine the very idea of literature</span>, to expose the whole endeavor of making art out of language as essentially and irredeemably fraudulent—and, even worse, silly. And there’s a link here to the other sense in which she was <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">ahead of her time</span>. <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">The standard reactions to her <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal">artistic defectiveness</span> were masochistic joy and a perverse desire to share the spectacularly failed artwork with others</span>. Just as “<span id="C_" class="mention concept" about="MusicPiece" data-label="Trapped in the Closet">Trapped in the Closet</span>”—the ridiculous specter of which even now haunts the entire <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="MusicGenre" data-label="Rhythm and blues">R&B genre</span>—caused the world to huddle together in the guttering glow of its laptop screens, <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ novels brought people together in <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">strange observances of ridicule</span>. Despite <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="AldousHuxley" data-label="Aldous Huxley">Huxley</span>’s persuasive linking of her to a literary past, it’s sometimes difficult to avoid the suspicion that she may have <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">inadvertently invented <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryMovement" data-label="postmodernism">postmodernism</span>.</p>


<p>The point at which <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> became a <span id="C3" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="fame">viral underground phenomenon</span>—what we might refer to nowadays as the tipping point—came when a copy of <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span> found its way into the hands of the critic and poet <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="BarryPain" data-label="Barry Pain">Barry Pain</span>. In <span id="D5" class="mention date" about="1898" data-label="1898">1898</span>, he wrote a <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryCriticism" data-label="LiteraryCriticism">review</span> of it for the <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="London journal Black & White">London journal Black & White</span>, the <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">mock-reverential spirit</span> of which more or less set the tone for <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ entire career. He begins the review by saying that the book was sent to him by some friends in Ireland who assumed that he would be amused by it. “<span CITATION>The book</span>,” he writes, “<span CITATION>has not amused. It began by doing that. Then, as its enormities went on getting more and more enormous in every line, the book seemed something titanic, gigantic, awe-inspiring. The world was full of <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span>, by <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Mrs. Amanda McKittrick Ros</span>, and I shrank before it in tears and in terror</span>.”</p>

<p><span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="ResponseToCriticism" data-label="Response To Criticism">Despite the fact that she effectively owed her entire career to <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="BarryPain" data-label="Barry Pain">Pain’s review</span>, <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> never forgave him for it</span>. When she published <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Delina Delaney">Delina Delaney</span> <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="1899" data-label="1899">the following year</span>, she included a foreword entitled “<span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryCriticism" data-label="Critics opinions">Criticism of Barry Pain on <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span></span>.” This is a 20-page harangue in which she mercilessly attacks “this so-called <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="BarryPain" data-label="Barry Pain">Barry Pain</span>” for taking it upon himself “<span CITATION>to criticise a work the depth of which fails to reach the solving power of his borrowed, and, he’d have you believe, varied talent</span>.” She goes on to announce that she cares nothing “<span CITATION>for the opinion of half-starved upstarts, who don the garb of a shabby-genteel, and fain would feed the mind of the people with the worthless scraps of stolen fancies</span>.” It marked the beginning of an <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="ResponseToCriticism" data-label="Response To Criticism">extraordinarily sour relationship with the entire <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryCriticism" data-label="LiteraryCriticism">literary-critical profession</span></span>, which, along with the legal profession (she was a prolific and highly eclectic litigant), formed the two points of her personal axis of evil. Here’s a small selection of the <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="ResponseToCriticism" data-label="Response To Criticism">many colorful epithets she flung at critics over the years</span>”;: “<span CITATION>auctioneering agents of Satan</span>”; “<span CITATION>bands of assumptionists</span>”; “<span CITATION>bastard donkey-headed mites</span>”; “<span CITATION>clay crabs of corruption</span>”; “<span CITATION>denouncing Arabs</span>”; “<span CITATION>evil-minded snapshots of spleen</span>”; “<span CITATION>genius scathers</span>”; “<span CITATION>hogwashing hooligans</span>”; “<span CITATION>rodents of state</span>”; “<span CITATION>street Arabs</span>”; and “<span CITATION>vicious vandals</span>.”<span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal"> <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> might not have been up to much as a novelist</span>, but she would have been excellent at coming up with names for punk bands.</p>


<p><span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="ResponseToCriticism" data-label="Response To Criticism">She didn’t restrict herself, either, to attacking critics in the paratextual addenda of her work</span>. <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Plot summary">In <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Delina Delaney">Delina Delaney</span>, an aristocratic dreamboat named Lord Gifford explains to the title character, an Irish peasant girl with whom he is in love, that his mother is hell-bent on forcing him into a more socioeconomically viable match with his evil cousin, Lady Mattie Maynard. Gifford insists that he has no intention of acquiescing. He is, in fact, planning to propose to Delina there and then. But before getting down on one knee, he for some reason decides to pick up a magazine that happens to be lying around in the drawing room and opens it to an unfavorable review of a novel recently published by May Marchmont, another, less evil—but equally alliterative—cousin. “<span CITATION>There can be no harm having a peep at this</span>,” Lord Gifford incorrectly presumes. <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArticleExposition" data-label="Autor Note">This <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="FictionalCaracter" data-label="May Marchmont">May Marchmont</span> is a pretty obvious stand-in for <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros herself</span></span>; she is admiringly described as Gifford’s “<span CITATION>clever cousin, who has won the praises of all nations—yea, the congratulations of crown heads—by her talented pen</span>.” For two whole pages, Lord Gifford rages inwardly against the “<span CITATION>self-opinionated mortals</span>” of the book-review racket before flinging the magazine into a bush, “<span CITATION>to be picked up and deposited in the drossy handbarrow next day by the gardener’s son</span>.” Once unburdened of the magazine, and of his thoughts on the current state of literary criticism in the popular press, Lord Gifford gives the matter “<span CITATION>no further thought</span>” and gets back to the business at hand: asking for Delina’s dainty digits in marriage.</span></p>

<p>In <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="_">O Rare Amanda!</span>, his <span id="D7" class="mention date" about="1954" data-label="1954">1954</span> biography of <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>, <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="JackLoudan" data-label="Jack Loudan">Jack Loudan</span> mentions that <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="ResponseToCriticism" data-label="Response To Criticism">she considered it an act of bad manners to write about a book without having been invited to do so by its author. Criticism, in her view, was a form of meddling in other people’s business</span>. She seems genuinely not to have understood (or at least never come near to acknowledging) that <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">her fame was due to the fact that almost all her readers were essentially <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryCriticism" data-label="LiteraryCriticism">critics</span></span>, in that their harsh judgment of her work was a prerequisite for their reading it. She imagined a division between her publishers and the general readership of her novels on one side and, on the other, those <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">critics like <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="BarryPain" data-label="Barry Pain">Pain</span> who were openly amused by those novels’ failings</span>. Such a division never really existed. <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">The <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="literal">success</span> that she never tired of bragging about (“<span CITATION>the congratulations of crown heads</span>”) was due entirely to the majestic scale of her <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal">artistic failure</span></span>. There were <span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="AmandaMcKittrickRosSocieties" data-label="Amanda McKittrick Ros Societies"><span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Amanda McKittrick Ros</span> societies</span> at <span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="UnivesityOfOxford" data-label="Univesity of Oxford">Oxford</span> and <span id="O4" class="mention organization" about="UnivesityOfCambridge" data-label="Univesity of Cambridge">Cambridge</span>. <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="CSLewis" data-label="C.S.

Lines from her books were commonly quoted in the hallways of the <span id="_" class="mention organization" about="HouseOf Commons" data-label="House of Commons">House of Commons. She was a sort of <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">Bizarro World <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="OscarWilde" data-label="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</span></span>: an Irish author who became a <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> <span id="C3" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">cause célèbre</span> for the complete witlessness of her writing. <span id="C3" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">Her fame even reached the shores of the <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="United States of America" data-label="United States of America" data-wikidata-id="Q30">New World</span></span>, with no less a figure than <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="MarkTwain" data-label="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</span> crowning her “<span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">Queen & Empress of the Hogwash Guild</span>.”</p>


<p>But could she really have been so naive? Could she have entirely failed to suspect that she was the victim of a vast conspiracy of ridicule? <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">Her readers were unusually invested in their own attachment to her work</span>, and knowledge of the <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span> oeuvre became a badge of identification, an <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">ironic signifier of cultural sophistication</span>. She received vast quantities of mail from her “fans,” for whom <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">a written response from the great <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Amanda</span> was a considerable trophy</span>, the deeper its shade of purple the better. She once received a letter from the writer <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="DonaghMacDonagh" data-label="Donagh MacDonagh">Donagh MacDonagh</span> (a close friend of <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="FlannOBrien" data-label="Flann O’Brien">Brian O’Nolan</span>, who would later become known to the literary world as <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="FlannOBrien" data-label="Flann O’Brien">Flann O’Brien</span>) asking her to come to <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Dublin" data-label="Dublin" data-wikidata-id="Q1761">Dublin</span> to appear on a panel discussing “The Trend of Modern Literature.” Perhaps sensing that the correspondent might not have been entirely in earnest, she never replied, thereby denying posterity a possible meeting of the authors of <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span> and <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="At Swim-Two-Birds">At Swim-Two-Birds</span>. But such suspicions were rarely allowed to surface. As <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="BarryPain" data-label="Barry Pain">Pain</span> had pointed out, one of the crucial features of her magisterially dreadful work is its total absence of anything even approaching a sense of humor: “<span CITATION>One thought before one read this book that one knew what the absence of that sense meant, but one didn’t. Mists rolled away, snowy peaks, never before scaled by human foot, of the very existence of which one never dreamt, stretched themselves heavenwards. Never was any absence so essentially and intrinsically absential, as the absence of the sense of humour in this book</span>.”</p>

<p>And so, for the most part, she took her readers’ unusual investment in her work as a token of admiration. She was steadfastly convinced that it was of the highest standard, that <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Irene Iddesleigh">Irene Iddesleigh</span> and <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Delina Delaney">Delina Delaney</span> were classics to stand alongside the work of <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DanielDefoe" data-label="Daniel Defoe">Defoe</span>, <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="TSEliot" data-label="T.S. Eliot">Eliot</span>, and <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="Charles Dickens" data-label="Charles Dickens">Dickens</span>. There was, for her, nothing the least bit funny about, say, the fact that most of the characters in her last novel, <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Helen Huddleson">Helen Huddleson</span>, were named after fruits and vegetables (from aristocrats like Lord Raspberry and Sir Christopher Currant right down the social scale to Madam Pear and Lily Lentil the servant girl). Readers like <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="CSLewis" data-label="C.S. Lewis">Lewis</span> and <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="JRRTolkien" data-label="J.R.R. Tolkien">Tolkien</span> who found <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">this kind of stuff a source of amusement</span> were, in her view, essentially unserious and motivated by jealousy of her talent. If they had been her students, she would have caned their frivolous arses to Narnia and back.</p>


<p>It’s a quality common to many <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">contemporary incarnations of the Epic Fail</span> (<span id="P19" class="mention person" about="TommyWiseau" data-label="Tommy Wiseau">Tommy Wiseau</span>, the actor-auteur behind the cult film <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="Movie" data-label="The Room">The Room</span>, being perhaps the most prominent example): a refusal to be dissuaded from the <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">belief in her own <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="literal">greatness</span></span> by the Greek chorus of ridicule that was the perennial backdrop of her career. <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ humorlessness was matched by an almost miraculous immunity to <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Lack of confidence">self-doubt—that Dutch elm disease of literary careers</span>. This was due at least in part to her never reading the aforementioned <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DanielDefoe" data-label="Daniel Defoe">Defoe</span>, <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="TSEliot" data-label="T.S. Eliot">Eliot</span>, <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="Charles Dickens" data-label="Charles Dickens">Dickens</span>, or really much of anything by anyone but herself. In <span id="D8" class="mention date" about="1930" data-label="1930">1930</span>, she wrote to her publisher <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="StanleyTMercer" data-label="Stanley T. Mercer">Stanley T. Mercer</span>, asking him what he thought about her chances of winning the <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Sincere">Nobel Prize for literature</span>. “<span CITATION>What think you of this prize?</span>” she asked. “<span CITATION>Do you think I should make a ‘dart’ for it?</span>”</p>

<p>There is something captivatingly comic, of course, about the idea of the <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">writer who owes her career to being terrible at her job</span>, and the intellectual slapstick of <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ various scuffles is first-rate stuff. But—and I don’t say this in any way ironically—there’s also something paradoxically inspiring about <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">her complete (and completely misplaced) confidence in the magnitude of her own talent</span>. Writers are famously egotistical people, but they are also typically tormented by self-doubt. <span id="P1" class="mention person" about="AnnaRoss" data-label="Anna Ross">Ros</span>’ <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">supreme self-confidence</span> was the reason for her producing such seductively <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal">mockable work</span>, but it made her largely impervious to the mockery it provoked. She may have been a <span id="C2" class="mention concept" about="literaryFailure" data-label="literal">complete failure</span> at the task she set for herself, but there was a <span id="C1" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">certain greatness in her character</span>.</p>
