<p> It’s typically linked to an individual’s bank balance and the assets they own, but having spent several months in a crowded, concrete lockdown, I’d argue <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Meaning">the true meaning of wealth is space</span>.

<p>Without<span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder"> deep fjords</span> or <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">skyscraping peaks</span>, central <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="Norway" data-label="Norway" data-wikidata-id="Q20">Norway</span> is often passed over.

<p>The indigenous <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Sami population</span> have always been <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Environment Exploiting">connected to their environment, their life revolving around eight seasons dictating the movement of reindeer</span>. “They’re all up in the mountains now,” says <span id="P3" class="mention person" about="LeifKarsten" data-label="Leif Karsten">Leif</span>, pointing to <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">snow-patched ranges hemming the Swedish border</span>.</p>

<p>Dressed in a neckerchief and beaten leather trousers, he leads me on horseback up dwarf-forest slopes and over granite covered in burnt-orange moss, until we can almost touch the sky. And when my Nordic steed breaks into its unique tolt gait, it feels like Ive taken flight on Pegasus. Bees and dragonflies flit between heather and fireweed, but there are already signs that summer is drawing to a close. In boggy meadows, tufts of cottongrass bow their white bonnets like ageing maidens, and ripe cloudberries glow sunset pink.</p>

<p>It has been a long, lazy few months, with plans put on hold by the pandemic. Back at the farm, Leif’s daughter-in-law, Lillian Brandsfjell, will have to wait a little longer before she can teach schoolchildren Sami crafts in a traditional gamme (turf house) as part of the national curriculum. Until 15 years ago, indigenous culture was suppressed and ridiculed, Lillian explains during a lunch of boiled reindeer meat and turnips. “When I was 18, a man grabbed me by the collar and told me to go to hell. How dare he? From that day, I decided no one would ever make me feel ashamed again.”</p>

<p>A tradition of strong women reigns in this region. Built in 1780 as a dairy farm, Troset, a 44-mile drive from Meraker, has been in the same family for 500 years. Heidi, its current owner, is the sixth-generation female in charge.</p>

<p>“Nothing has changed here, the sky, the view, the mountains – they are all the same,” muses the former financial worker who retrained in alternative therapies and retreated here to recharge her batteries.</p>

<p>Troset sits on one of several ancient pilgrim paths that weave through Norway and lead to the tomb of the 11th-century St Olav in Trondheim’s Nidaros Cathedral. We meet at a natural spring on the trail where she comes to drink water every day. “It was dry for many years,” she tells me. But the moment she decided to share her space with pilgrims and travellers, the water started to flow again. “This was a way to open my heart.”</p>

<p>In a garden of wild flowers overlooking lakes and pastures, we perform a Qigong peace ritual, mimicking movements of sea turtles swimming in the ocean and eagles soaring through the air. Heidi’s gentle manner is even warmer than the low-slung amber sun.</p>

<p>Fewer than 200 people pass through Troset each year, but she has no urgent plans to expand. One visiting priest astutely suggested Heidi’s new-found vocation was no coincidence: Troset translates as “belief place”.</p>

<p>Serendipity also guided entrepreneurs Frode and Kristine Sakshaug in the construction of their Oyna landscape hotel in Inderoy, a 50-minute drive north. What started as a pitch for putball (a hybrid game of football and golf) became an eco-hotel carved into the hillside, where rooms appear to float high above the Trondheimsfjord.</p>

<p>Launching in the middle of a pandemic was challenging, but with lockdown rules eased for Norwegians a couple of weeks after the hotel opened, it has been almost fully booked ever since.</p>

<p>Solidarity has glued this community together. Frode, who grew up and played on the land where his hotel now sits, employed local businesses for construction and eschewed lucrative deals to work with an investor he knows and trusts. He constantly talks about “we” and “us”. It’s a reminder that money isn’t the only motivation in life.</p>

<p>Further north, on Stokkoya, an island in the Norwegian Sea, Torild Langklopp and Roar Svenning have spent almost two decades building a social enterprise to benefit their community. A bakery and affordable housing are part of a drive to attract people to live in the countryside, while a beach bar, glamping site and rustic cabins at the Stokkoya Sjosenter give visitors a taste of coastal living.</p>

<p>At low tide, we forage seaweed from the shore and take a boat ride flanked by sea eagles to collect wild scallops. The shallow water is so clear, I can reach down and collect shells wrapped in ribbons of kelp.</p>

<p>“During the pandemic, we went out fishing most days,” reminisces Roar that evening, as chefs prepare our catch a few sandy feet from the lapping waves. “We had everything we needed.”</p>

<p>As we talk, I’m swept up in their tidal wave of innovative ideas: jazz concerts on the rocks, moonlit dancers emerging from the surf, and a philosophy for a new way of existence. Our thinking cogs are oiled with shots of Granskauen gin, distilled by local barman Dustin Zimmerman and his partner Maren Grotte. It’s infused with spruce shoots, dandelion root and birch leaves, and the couple describe it as “a walk through the forest”.</p>

<p>Like so many products made in the countryside, Granskauen is served in the city, too. I encounter it again on the menu at the Michelin-starred Speilsalen restaurant in the newly renovated Britannia hotel in Trondheim. In the 19th century, “salmon lords and ladies” from the English aristocracy would stay here after fishing expeditions. It is now a grand five-star hotel: gold accents fleck the stairwells, bathtubs, and even a sparkling pastry on my dinner plate.</p>

<p>Although UK travellers have been missed, proceedings have not ground to a halt. In the absence of masks and Plexiglass screens, bottles of sanitiser are the only reminder of a pandemic from which Norway has escaped relatively unscathed. Perhaps it is the high standard of living, the clean air or the amount of space, but life generally feels happier and healthier here. That thought stays with me as I take a final train journey two hours south to Oppdal, to meet the area’s oldest resident: the muskox.</p>

<p>Although the antecedents of the current 300-strong population at Dovrefjell National Park were introduced in 1947, an unearthing of ancient bones close to the local railway suggests the arctic mammals are no strangers to these parts.</p>

<p>In the distance, a solitary bull shrugs its shaggy mane, but in a couple of weeks dull thuds will echo for miles through mountain valleys as dominant males start rutting and autumn landscapes turn redder than a muskox’s blood. Shawls of lime-green lichen drape the hillsides, embroidered with button mushrooms and bluebell trumpets sweet enough to eat. Guide Sigbjorn Frengen tells me about his lockdown walks through Dovrefjell, and finding sense and reassurance in the big skies and wide horizons.</p>

<p>Through their connection to sea, soil and air, Trondelag’s earthy residents have given me a new perspective on times ahead.</p>
