                                <p class="distant"> As the small plane banked steeply, I looked down on the <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">bug-eyed figure of a man pointing enigmatically at the sky</span>. It could have been a cartoon character from a contemporary TV show but the <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">35m-high geoglyph, known as the Astronaut</span>, was created around <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Ancient">2,000 years ago and</span>, after more than 80 years of research, we can still only guess why.


                                <span class="datePublished">Around 400km south of <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="Lima" data-label="Lima" data-wikidata-id="Q2868">Lima</span>, the <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> are <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">huge, intricate drawings etched on to the barren landscape of <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">Peru’s coastal desert</span></span>. They have perplexed <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Scientifical Study">archaeologists, anthropologists, scientists and enthusiastic amateurs</span> since they were discovered in the <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1920">1920s</span>. Over the years they’ve been identified as everything from an <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">astrological calendar to sacred pathways</span>, <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Alien Theories">a map of water sources to alien landing strips</span>, but their exact purpose and meaning still remain unknown.</span>


                                <p>It’s believed that the <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca people</span>, who predate the <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Incas</span> by as much as 2,000 years, created the lines. Skilled agriculturists, they <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">settled along fertile river valleys fed by water from the <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">Andes</span> around <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="200BC" data-label="200 BC">200 BC</span></span>. Here, they built <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Human Creation">complex irrigation systems and aqueducts, created sophisticated pottery and elaborate textiles</span> and, despite the harsh conditions, flourished for eight centuries.

                                During that time they treated the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">desert</span> as an enormous canvas. <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">Using their hands and rudimentary wooden tools</span>, <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Process">they dug shallow trenches removing the dark stones and top soil to reveal the lighter coloured earth underneath</span>, creating literally <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">hundreds of enormous lines, geometric shapes and recognisable zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures</span>.

                                That they’re still visible today is thanks to <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Nazca</span>’s extreme environment. It’s one of the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Extreme Condition">driest places on the planet, with as little as 2mm of rain a year</span>. The <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Process">sun-hardened surface has set the stones in the soil, a rich mixture of clay and gypsum; the harsh wind known as the paracas (‘sand rain’ in Quechua) is deflected by the heat rising from the stones, minimising erosion and helping to preserve them intact</span>.</p>

                                <h2 class="medium grey distant">Flight of fancy</h2>

                                <p>The <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Trace">lines</span> are spread across a <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">500 sq km desert plateau</span> and their sheer size – some of the largest are 200m across – means that they can only be properly seen from the air. As I flew north from the city of <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Nazca</span>, over the vast, arid pampa of <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="Palpa" data-label="Palpa" data-wikidata-id="Q2640020">Palpa</span>, flanked by the <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">long spine of the Andean foothills</span>, stark <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">white lines began to appear</span>. Straight at first, <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">they criss-crossed the ochre and rust-red earth of the desert floor</span>. They soon began to <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">form simple geometric shapes – rectangles, triangles, trapeziums – </span> until I caught sight of the first of the most legendary lines, the <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">menagerie of elaborate birds and animals</span>.

                                “Coming up on your left, the  <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Ballena</span>,” said the voice in my headphones over the roar of the engine. I scanned the ground trying to pick out the faint form of a killer whale from the muddle. The plane tipped and dipped, left and right.

                                “ <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Perro [dog]</span>,” the voice said, moments later, and then,  <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">“Mono”, as the distinctive Nazca monkey</span> with its spiral tail came into view. I was enthralled by the figures –  <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">the elegant Colibri, or hummingbird, and what was clearly a gigantic spider</span>. I twisted from side to side as the lines appeared and disappeared in quick succession, undeterred by the surges of thermal turbulence that had several of my fellow passengers reaching for their sick bags.</p>

                                <h2 class="medium grey distant">Lady of the Lines</h2>

                                <p>How were the <span id="L15" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> created so precisely? Some continue for kilometres on end. And why? Even their dates are uncertain, estimated from shards of pottery found nearby.

                                Peruvian archaeologist <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="ToribioMejíaXesspe" data-label="Toribio Mejía Xesspe">Toribio Mejía Xesspe</span> rediscovered the lines in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1926">1926</span> but one of the first to comprehensively study them was American geologist <span id="P3" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Paul Kosok</span>. In <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1939">1939</span> <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span> was conducting <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Scientifical Study">studies on ancient irrigation systems</span> when a pilot told him about <span id="L16" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span>. He soon realised that they were <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">too shallow to carry water, so must have another purpose; he assumed it was astronomical after seeing the sun setting exactly over the end of one of the long, single lines at the winter solstice</span>. He christened <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca</span> ‘the largest astronomy book in the world’.

                                Later, <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span>’s assistant, <span id="P6" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Maria Reiche</span>, a German-born teacher and mathematician, found the same effect occurred on the summer solstice. She began to map the lines and discovered <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">18 different kinds of animals and birds</span>. After <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span> left <span id="L18" class="mention place" about="Peru" data-label="Peru" data-wikidata-id="Q419">Peru</span> in the <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1940">1940s</span>, <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> remained, dedicating her life to unravelling the mystery.

                                Her former home near <span id="L19" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca</span>, where she’s buried, is now a small museum, filled with her <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">yellowing maps, blueprints, measuring tape and rolls of papers</span>. There are <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">photographs of her perched on top of a ladder in the middle of the desert, squinting in the bright sunlight to examine the lines; she even persuaded the <span class="credit"><span id="O1" class="mention organization" about="PAF" data-label="Peruvian Air Force">Peruvian Air Force</span> to help her make aerial photographic surveys</span></span>.</p>

                                <p>Dubbed <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Human Agent">‘the Lady of the Lines’</span>, she also brought them to the world’s attention and played a vitally important role in their protection and conservation, educating both the public and the <span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="PeruvianGovernment" data-label="Peruvian Government">Peruvian government</span></span> about their importance. She paid for private security to prevent them from further damage and convinced the government to limit access to the area. In <span id="D5" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1994">1994</span>, four years before her death, the lines were finally declared a <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="World Heritage Site"><span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="Unesco" data-label="U/nesco">Unesco</span></span> World Heritage Site</span> – though not in time to save the <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Lizard</span>, which was sliced in two by the Pan-American Highway.

                                <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> believed <span id="L20" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> were built with <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Precision">sophisticated mathematical precision</span>. However, in <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1968">1968</span> the English astronomer <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="GeraldHawkins" data-label="Gerald Hawkins">Gerald Hawkins</span> effectively <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">disproved her theory of astronomical alignment</span>. He specialised in the field of archaeoastronomy and, using the same <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">techniques he applied at <span id="L21" class="mention place" about="Stonehenge" data-label="Stonehenge" data-wikidata-id="Q39671">Stonehenge</span>, found that <span id="L22" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> he studied didn’t correspond to any celestial bodies</span>.

                                The same year, perhaps the most implausible theory on the lines came from Swiss author, <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="ErichvonDaniken" data-label="Erich von Daniken">Erich von Daniken</span>, who <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Alien theories">suggested in his book, Chariots of the Gods, that they were the runways of an ancient airfield used by extraterrestrial spacecraft</span>. Other researchers believe that <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction"><span id="L23" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> are a precursor of the <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Inca</span> ceques (sacred pathways) that radiate from <span id="L24" class="mention place" about="Cusco" data-label="Cusco" data-wikidata-id="Q205057">Cusco</span></span>, or <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">a giant map pinpointing underground <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">water supplies</span></span>. <br>
                                Because <span id="L25" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> are best seen from above, there are those who suspected that <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction"><span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span> were capable of flight long before <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="LeonardoDaVinci" data-label="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</span> sketched his <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Craft">flying machines</span></span>. Pottery remains depict what could have been a kite or balloon, so enterprising researchers created a balloon out of materials that would have been available to <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span>; after several attempts, it was airborne for less than 15 minutes.</p>

                                <h2 class="medium grey distant">Exalting the elements</h2>

                                <p>While most people only view the <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> from the air, to really grasp their scale and the harsh nature of the terrain, you need to see them at  quarters. Before <span id="D7" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1994">1994</span>, you could drive up to them in your car but now the st you can get is the <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Building">observation tower</span> that <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> helped to sponsor.

                                Climbing the rickety metal staircase, I could see how <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Human Creation">the Pan-American Highway had split the barren landscape in half, disappearing into the horizon en route to <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Chile" data-label="Chile" data-wikidata-id="Q298">Chile</span></span>. The odd lorry rumbled by, but then all was silent save for the whistling wind.

                                The <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">flat, rock-covered plain stretched as far as my eyes could see, only broken up by the occasional dune and the pale lines that, from <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="human Creation">that tower</span>, appeared as wide as a pathway</span>. I looked out in awe over the upside-down <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">figure of the Tree</span> – <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">perhaps the tree of life, or more likely the huarango tree that used to flourish here; with the longest roots of any tree in the world it could reach the deepest water and would bring it back to the surface for other plants</span>.</p>

                                <p>Next to it is the figure known as <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">the Hands</span>, one with four fingers, the other with five. According to <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué Lancho Rojas</span>, it’s more likely a frog or a toad. <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué</span> is a historian and <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca</span> expert. At 68, he’s spent years studying <span id="L28" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span>, working ly with archaeologists such as the Italian, <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="GiuseppeOrefici" data-label="Giuseppe Orefici">Giuseppe Orefici</span>, whose finds can be seen in the small but fascinating <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Museo Didáctico Antonini in Nazca</span>.

                                Simply put, <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué</span> believes that <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">the area is a giant open-air temple, designed for pilgrimage and worship</span>. “You have to imagine the world of 2,000 years ago,” he told me. “<span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca people</span> had simple lives but they were extremely religious. Everyone believed, not in a god they couldn’t see, but in the elemental world around them – the sun, moon, stars, wind and water.”

                                <span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca</span>, he told me, came from nanasca, a <span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Quechua</span> word that means pain and suffering – probably coined due to the long periods of drought the people suffered. They were dependent on nature for their survival – <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">water, or lack of it</span>, ruled their lives. “From January to March there was water in the river, from April to December they would pray for rain.”</p>

                                <p><span id="P18" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué</span> believes that <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">each clan had a minor god, whose figure was represented on the pampa. Around 80% of the figures consist of just one line; he thinks that these were designed to be walked on, and that the straight lines were roads that would lead the people to their figures</span>.

                                <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">Their figures were from the world around them: so not an astronaut (a name given by one of the first pilots to fly over it) but a shaman; not a condor but a long-tailed mockingbird</span>. I asked about the monkey and the parrot, both from the Amazon. “<span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">They would have traded with the jungle peoples,” Josué explained</span>.

                                On important dates the <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span> would <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">carry out ceremonies on the lines as an offering to the gods in the sky to secure a flow of water from the <span id="L29" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">Andes</span></span>. “<span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">Around October, they would check the cloud formations in the mountains and, if by the December solstice there was no rain, there would be human sacrifices to appease the gods and ensure their good will</span>,” <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué</span> told me. This theory is borne out by the mummified, severed heads in the <span id="L30" class="mention place" about="Ica" data-label="Ica Museum" data-wikidata-id="Q208186">Ica Regional Museum</span>. They have hair (again, thanks to the preserving desert climate) and a rope threaded though a hole in the skull, presumably to help people carry them.

                                <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="JosuéLanchoRojas" data-label="Josué Lancho Rojas">Josué</span> doesn’t believe they were exceptional mathematicians and astronomers, although that theory appeals to nationalistic pride; <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">they were, he reckons, just a society in which everyone developed a skill and had a part to play</span>. Their knowledge of weaving, for example, helped them to translate the images on to the vast canvas of the pampa. And as for the alien theory, he simply rolled his eyes.</p>
