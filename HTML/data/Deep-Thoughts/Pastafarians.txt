<p>
<span>Some time next year, the <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="ECHR" data-label="ECHR">European court of human rights</span></span> will decide on the case of a <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Dutch woman who feels unfairly treated</span> because her country’s <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Statement">highest court has told her <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Statement">she cannot wear a plastic colander on her head for her ID photo</span></span>.</p>

<p>It may combine <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="MinkeDeWilde" data-label="Minke De Wilde">Mienke de Wilde</span>’s <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Statement">plea</span> with that of an <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Austrian former MP</span>, <span id="P3" class="mention person" about="NikoAlm" data-label="Niko Alm">Niko Alm</span>, who <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">proudly wears the offending kitchen utensil on his official documents</span> but now <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">insists his country recognise <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> – the faith both follow – as a <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">religion</span></span>.</p>

<p><span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">Watching the pair closely</span> is <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Mike Arthur</span>, an independent American film-maker whose smart, funny but above all thought-provoking <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">documentary</span>, I, Pastafari, about the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">world’s fastest-growing faith</span> premieres in the <span id="L2" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> in October.</p>

<p>All in all, it is shaping up to be quite a big few months for the <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</span>, whose <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believers</span> <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">wear strainers on their heads in homage to their deity, strive to be nice to pretty much everyone, and conclude their prayers with “r’amen” rather than “amen”</span>.</p>

<p>It sounds, of course, like a joke. On one level, it is. But for <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Arthur</span>, who has spent three years working on his <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">film</span>, and for many <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> who believe their <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">faith embodies some profound – and profoundly important – principles</span>, it is a lot more.</p>

<p>“We live,” says <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Arthur</span>, sitting in an <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Amsterdam" data-label="Amsterdam" data-wikidata-id="Q727">Amsterdam</span> cafe, “in the age of unreason. We no longer value the best idea, but the loudest idea. From <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="Brexit">Brexit</span></span> to <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Trump</span>, we applaud <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Faith">blind faith</span> and are sceptical about <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">overwhelming observable evidence</span>.</p>

<p>“The problem is that <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">rationality</span> is just no match for <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Faith">irrationality</span>. That ship sailed in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span>. People now don’t change their minds, they double down on their irrationality, and using <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">facts, science and reason</span> to <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">contest the unreasonable</span> is simply driving us all further apart. Maybe it’s time to try a different approach.”</p>

<p>A different approach is, undeniably, what <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> offers. The church was founded in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2005" data-label="2005">2005</span> by <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Bobby Henderson</span>, at the time a 25-year-old <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">physics</span> graduate, as a response to <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">Christian fundamentalists</span> demanding the <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Teaching">teaching</span> of <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism</span> in <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="Kansas" data-label="Kansas" data-wikidata-id="Q1558">Kansas</span> school <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Education">science classes</span>. Its name is a portmanteau of pasta and <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Rastafarianism">Rastafarianism</span>.</p>

<p>In an open letter, <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Henderson</span> argued that if <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">intelligent design</span> was to be taught alongside <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Evolution">evolution</span>, so should the belief that, <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Pastafarianism">with the aid of His Noodly Appendages, an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe, probably after drinking heavily (thus explaining its many flaws)</span>.</p>

<p>Like other <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">religions</span>, the <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">church</span> has a <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">gospel</span> and, rather than commandments, eight <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">“I’d really rather you didn’ts”</span> (two having been lost). These suggest ways to <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">live your life happily without infringing on others’ rights to do the same</span> – a morality based on <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">harmonious co-existence, nonjudgmental conduct “and generally not being a dick</span>”.</p>

<p><span id="P11" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Henderson</span>’s basic point, expertly if satirically made, was that <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">since <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">intelligent design</span> was every bit as much of an <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">evidence-based theory</span> as the <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">unshakable belief that the world was created by an omniscient flying monster made of spaghetti</span>, nothing should be <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Teaching">taught in science classes</span> but <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">science</span></span>.</p>

<p>But as it has grown – there are now <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> from <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="Poland" data-label="Poland" data-wikidata-id="Q36">Poland</span> to <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="NewZealand" data-label="New Zealand" data-wikidata-id="Q664">New Zealand</span> and <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Italy" data-label="Italy" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> to <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Taiwan" data-label="Taiwan" data-wikidata-id="Q865">Taiwan</span>, and <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">the church</span> is <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">officially recognised</span> in at least four countries – it has begun posing bigger questions: <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what actually is a religion? Who gets to decide that? And why should faith – or lack of it – have anything to do with rights?</span></p>

<p>For <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Derk Venema</span>, an eloquent Dutch legal expert who has worked with <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="MinkeDeWilde" data-label="Minke De Wilde">De Wilde</span>, his former student, to <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">develop her arguments for <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">wearing a colander</span> on her driving licence photo</span>, <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> raises <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">genuine human rights issues</span> – even if (or perhaps because)<span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Satire"> it is also satirical</span>.</p>

<p>“I started out thinking this was just a big joke,” <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span> says. “But the more you look at it, the more you see it is about <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">fundamental principles</span>. The <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="DutchCourts" data-label="Dutch Courts">Dutch courts</span></span> have <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">denied it has any serious message</span>, but it manifestly does: <span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">non-violence, tolerance, loving each other</span> – the same principles as <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">many established religions</span>.”</p>

<p>The <span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="ECHR" data-label="ECHR">European court</span> has previously determined that <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">to be recognised as such, a <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">religion</span> must be cogent, coherent, important to its followers, and “serious”</span>. On the latter point, <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span> argues that <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Poiliteness">the humour and good fun</span> of <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> is simply a more <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Satire">modern, accessible way of getting its message across</span>.</p>

<p>“I can imagine it all looks very odd if you’re <span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">not a believer</span>. But that’s the case with <span id="C75" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">many faiths – people who walk on water or split themselves in three</span>, for example. Personally, I find other religions unbelievable.”</p>

<p>Moreover, argues <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span>, even <span id="C77" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">theologians have “never really been able to agree on what constitutes a religion. So should the state really get to decide</span>? For me, if it looks like a religion, with certain <span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">customs and traditions</span>; if <span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">its followers</span> <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">call it a religion</span>; and if <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">they call themselves believers</span>, that should be it.”</p>

<p>Most importantly, in many societies <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">belief</span> in an <span id="C83" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">established religion</span> comes with certain privileges: from the <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">right to sport religious headwear on your ID photo</span> in the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="Netherlands" data-label="Netherlands" data-wikidata-id="Q55">Netherlands</span>, to <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">faith schools</span> in the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">UK</span> and <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">full-scale tax exemption</span> for <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q145">US</span> megachurches. “We say, as long as there are <span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">special rights</span> for <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believers</span>, they should apply to all religions,” says <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span>.</p>

<p><span id="P20" class="mention person" about="NikoAlm" data-label="Niko Alm">Alm</span>, a journalist, writer, publisher and former MP, <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">has fought his five-year court battle to get <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> recognised as a religion</span> in <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Austria" data-label="Austria" data-wikidata-id="Q40">Austria</span> as part of a broader struggle for a <span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">true separation of church and state</span> and <span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">genuine religious freedom</span> – which, he argues, should include  <span id="C93" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">freedom from religion</span>.</p>

<p>“All we <span id="C94" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">ask is a level playing field</span>,” he says. "<span id="C95" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">Total neutrality of the state towards whatever belief I hold</span>. We don’t want anything forbidden, but <span id="C96" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">the law must apply equally to all of us</span>, <span id="C97" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">whatever we believe in</span> and whether <span id="C98" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">we believe nothing at all</span>. <span id="C99" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">Complete freedom of religion</span>. It’s political.”</p>

<p>He readily concedes, however, that <span id="C100" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> is a diverse church. “For some, it’s not a political thing at all. In some countries, <span id="C101" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> mainly just want <span id="C102" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">to have fun and eat pasta</span>.”</p>
