<p class="distant">By now, you’ve probably heard of <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>, the internet <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span> that has <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">taken hold</span> among many on the <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">American right</span>.</p>

<p>But you may still have questions about what exactly is going on.</p>

<p><span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> was once a fringe phenomenon — the kind most people could safely ignore. But recently, it has gone mainstream. In <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="2020">2020</span>, <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer"><span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> supporters</span> <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Fake News">flooded social media with false information</span> about <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">Covid-19</span>, the <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">Black Lives Matter protests</span> and the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">presidential election</span>, and <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">recruited legions of new believers to their ranks</span>. A December <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">poll</span> by <span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="NPR" data-label="NPR">NPR </span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="Ipsos" data-label="Ipsos">Ipsos</span></span> found that <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">17 percent of Americans</span> believed that the core falsehood of <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> — that “<span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> group of Satan-worshiping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media</span>a” — was true.</p>

<p><span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also seeped into the offline world. <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Followers of the movement</span> participated in the deadly <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"> Capitol riot</span> in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="January">January</span>, and other <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> have been <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">charged with violent crimes, including kidnappings, assassination plots and the <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="2019">2019</span> murder of a mafia boss in <span id="L1" class="mention place" about="NewYork" data-label="New York" data-wikidata-id="Q60">New York</span></span>.

<p><span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also made inroads in <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Republican</span> politics. Representative <span id="P6" class="mention person" about="MarjorieTaylorGreene" data-label="Marjorie Taylor Greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</span>, a first-term congresswoman from <span id="L2" class="mention place" about="Georgia" data-label="Georgia" data-wikidata-id="Q1428">Georgia</span>, has become the most prominent <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">QAnon-affiliated lawmaker</span> in the country. (<span id="P7" class="mention person" about="MarjorieTaylorGreene" data-label="Marjorie Taylor Greene">Ms. Greene</span>, who posted in support of <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> on <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">social media</span>, has said she regrets her posts, but continues to <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">promote many QAnon-supported conspiracy theories</span>.) Elected <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Republicans</span> at the state and local levels have also <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">expressed support</span> for <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is an incredibly convoluted theory, and you could fill an entire book explaining its various tributaries and subtheories. But here are some basic things you should know.</p>

<h2 class="distant">What is <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>?</h2>

<p><span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is the umbrella term for a set of internet conspiracy theories that allege, falsely, that <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> believe that <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">this cabal includes top <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Democrats</span> like <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="JosephBiden" data-label="Joseph Biden">President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</span>, <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</span>, <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="BarackObama" data-label="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</span> and <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="GeorgeSoros" data-label="George Soros">George Soros</span>, as well as a number of entertainers and <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Hollywood" data-label="Hollywood" data-wikidata-id="Q34006">Hollywood</span> celebrities like <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="OprahWinfrey" data-label="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</span>, <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="TomHanks" data-label="Tom Hanks">Tom Hanks</span> and <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="EllenDeGeneres" data-label="Ellen DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</span> and religious figures including <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="PopeFrancis" data-label="Pope Francis">Pope Francis</span> and <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DalaiLama" data-label="Dalai Lama">the Dalai Lama</span></span>. Many of them also believe that, <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">in addition to molesting children, members of this group kill and eat their victims to extract a life-extending chemical called adrenochrome</span>.</p>

<p>According to <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon lore</span>, <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">former <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">President Donald J. Trump</span> was recruited by top military generals to run for president in <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> to break up this criminal conspiracy and bring its members to justice. Many of these cabal members will soon be arrested, the theory goes, and some will be imprisoned at <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="GuantánamoBay" data-label="Guantánamo Bay" data-wikidata-id="Q208035">Guantánamo Bay</span>, while others will face military tribunals and be executed</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Is that all?</h2>

<p>Not by a long shot. Since it began, <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has incorporated elements of many <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">other conspiracy theorycommunities</span>, including <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">claims about the assassination of <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</span>, <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the existence of U.F.O.s</span>, and the <span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">9/11 “truther” movement</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">QAnon Anonymous, a podcast</span> about the <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon movement</span>, calls <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> a <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">“big tent conspiracy theory”</span> because it is constantly evolving and adding new features and claims. But the <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">existence of a global pedophile cabal</span> is the core tenet of <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>, and the one that <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">most, if not all, of its followers</span> believe.</p>

<p>Since the <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="D7" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="2020">2020</span> election</span>, <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also become a stronghold of support for the <span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">false theory that the election was stolen from <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span></span>. Some <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> maintain that <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">he is still the lawful president</span>, although some have reluctantly accepted <span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">the reality that he is not</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">How did this all start?</h2>

<p>In <span id="D8" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="2017">October 2017</span>, a <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">post</span> appeared on <span class="credit"><span id="O5" class="mention organization" about="4chan" data-label="4chan">4chan</span></span>, the notoriously toxic message board, from an <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">anonymous account</span> calling itself <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">“Q Clearance Patriot”</span>. This poster, who became known simply as <span id="P21" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">“Q”</span>, claimed to be a <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">high-ranking government insider with access to classified information about <span id="P22" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span>’s war against the global cabal</span></p>

<p><span id="P23" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">“Q”</span> predicted that <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">this war would soon culminate in <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">“The Storm”</span> — an appointed time when <span id="P23" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> would finally unmask the cabal, punish its members for their crimes and restore <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="USA" data-label="USA" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> to greatness</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Why is it called ‘<span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">“The Storm”</span>’?</h2>

<p>It’s a reference to a cryptic remark <span id="P26" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> made during an <span id="D10" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="October 2017">October 2017</span> photo op. Posing alongside military generals, <span id="P27" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> said, “<span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">You guys know what this represents? Maybe it’s the calm before the storm</span>.”</p>

<p><span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> pointed to this moment as <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">proof that<span id="P28" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> was sending coded messages about his plans to break up the global cabal</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Who is <span id="P29" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>, and what are <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">‘Q Drops’</span>?</h2>

<p><span id="P30" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s identity is still unknown, although there have been <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">hints and speculation</span> about it for years. Some speculate that <span id="C83" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">a single internet troll has been <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">posting</span> as <span id="P31" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span> the entire time</span>; others say that <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">multiple people are involved in <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">posting</span> as <span id="P32" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span></span>, or that <span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"><span id="P33" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s identity has changed over time</span>.</p>

<p>Making things more complicated is that <span id="P34" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s online home base has changed several times. <span id="P35" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s posts originally appeared on <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="4chan" data-label="4chan">4chan</span></span>. Then they moved to <span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="8chan" data-label="8chan">8chan</span></span>, where they stayed until <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">that site was taken offline last year after the <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="L6" class="mention place" about="ElPaso" data-label="El Paso" data-wikidata-id="Q16562">El Paso</span> mass shooting</span></span>. They now live on <span class="credit"><span id="O8" class="mention organization" about="8kun" data-label="8kun">8kun</span></span>, a site run by the former owner of <span class="credit"><span id="O9" class="mention organization" about="8chan" data-label="8chan">8chan</span></span>. Each of these sites uses a <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anonymity">system of identity verification known as a “tripcode” — essentially, a username that proves that a series of anonymous posts were written by the same person or people</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">“Drops”"</span>" are what <span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> call <span id="P36" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s posts. There have been nearly 5,000 of them so far, and most take the form of a cryptic coded message.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Like What?</h2>

<p>Here’s an example of a <span id="C93" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">Q drop</span> from  <span id="D11" class="mention date" about="2018" data-label="September 2018">September 2018</span>:</p>

<p>And that’s just the <span id="C119" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">content that is explicitly pro-QAnon</span>.

<h2 class="distant">Who believes in <span id="C127" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>?</h2>

<p>It’s a more diverse group than you might imagine. The <span id="C128" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">earliest adherents</span> were mainly <span id="C129" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">far-right <span id="P64" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Trump</span> supporters</span>, but in <span id="D15" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="2020">2020</span>, the movement expanded its reach to include <span id="C130" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">health-conscious yoga moms</span>, <span id="C131" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy theories">anti-lockdown libertarians</span> and <span id="C132" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">evangelical Christians</span>. Unlike the stereotypes of extremist movements, <span id="C133" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> doesn’t appear to be primarily dominated by young men, or people experiencing economic pain. There are <span id="C134" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer"><span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Harvard" data-label="Harvard" data-wikidata-id="Q13371">Harvard</span> graduates and <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="WallStreet" data-label="Wall Street" data-wikidata-id="Q11690">Wall Street</span> executives who believe in it, as well as people with less elite pedigrees</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C135" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also developed an international presence, and has been embraced by <span id="C136" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">conspiracy theorists</span> and <span id="C137" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">far-right extremists</span> in countries including the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">United Kingdom</span>, <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> and <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Japan" data-label="Japan" data-wikidata-id="Q17">Japan</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Is <span id="C138" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> the same thing as <span id="C139" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>?</h2>

<p>Yes and no. <span id="C140" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has been described as a “big-budget sequel” to <span id="C141" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>, because it takes the original <span id="C142" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate conspiracy theory</span> — which alleged, falsely, that <span id="C143" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> <span id="P65" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton<">Mrs. Clinton</span> and her cronies were operating a child sex-trafficking ring out of the basement of a <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="DC" data-label="Washington D.C." data-wikidata-id="Q61">Washington, DC</span>, pizza restaurant</span> — and adds many more layers of narrative on top of it. But <span id="C144" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">many people believe in both theories</span>, and for many <span id="C145" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span>, <span id="C146" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> was a kind of gateway to the larger world of <span id="C147" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">right-wing <span id="C148" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>.</p>

<p>One new element in <span id="C149" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is a number of <span id="C150" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">clear and specific predictions about when and how “<span id="C151" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">The Storm</span>” would play out</span>. For years, <span id="P66" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span> has predicted that <span id="C152" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">mass arrests of cabal members would occur on certain days, that certain government reports would reveal the cabal’s misdeeds and that <span id="P67" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> would coast to a landslide re-election</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C153" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">None of those predictions came true</span>. But most <span id="C154" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> didn’t care. They simply found ways to reframe the narrative and ignore the discrepancies, and moved on.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Why are some people attracted to the <span id="C155" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon movement</span>?</h2>

<p>A common misconception is that <span id="C156" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is purely a political movement. But it functions, for <span id="C157" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe in it</span>, as both <span id="C158" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">a social community and a source of entertainment</span>.</p>

<p>Some people have compared <span id="C159" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> to a massive multiplayer online game, because of the way it <span id="C160" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">invites participants to cocreate a kind of shared reality filled with recurring characters, shifting story lines and intricate puzzle-solving quests</span>. <span id="C161" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also been compared to a church, in that it <span id="C162" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">provides its followers with a social support structure as well as an organizing narrative for their everyday lives</span>.</p>

<p><span id="P68" class="mention person" about="AdrianHon" data-label="Adrian Hon">Adrian Hon</span>, a game designer who has written about <span id="C163" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>’s similarity to alternate-reality games, says that believers “<span id="C164" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">open a fascinating fantasy world of secret wars and cabals and <span id="P69" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</span> controlling things, and it offers convenient explanations for things that feel inexplicable or wrong about the world</span>.”</p>

<h2 class="distant">What role have <span id="C165" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">social networks</span> played in <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>’s popularity?</h2>

<p>Even though <span id="C166" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">Q’s posts</span> appear on <span id="C167" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">fringe message boards</span>, the <span id="C168" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon phenomenon</span> owes much of its popularity to <span class="credit"><span id="O21" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span>, <span class="credit"><span id="O22" class="mention organization" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook">Facebook</span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O23" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>, which have <span id="C169" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">amplified <span id="C170" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> messages and recommended <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> groups and pages to new people through their algorithms</span>.</p>

<p>In recent months, many leading social networks have taken steps to ban <span id="C172" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> content from their services, citing the theory’s potential for offline harm. In <span id="D16" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="October 2019">October</span>, <span class="credit"><span id="O24" class="mention organization" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook">Facebook</span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O25" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> both announced <span id="C173" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">wide-ranging <span id="C174" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> bans, and removed thousands of accounts, pages, and channels from their platforms</span>. <span class="credit"><span id="O26" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span> has <span id="C175" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">banned thousands of <span id="C176" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> accounts for engaging in coordinated harassment</span>. And several smaller platforms, such as <span class="credit"><span id="O27" class="mention organization" about="Etsy" data-label="Etsy">Etsy</span></span>, <span class="credit"><span id="O28" class="mention organization" about="Pinterest" data-label="Pinterest">Pinterest</span></span>, and <span class="credit"><span id="O29" class="mention organization" about="Discord" data-label="Discord">Discord</span></span>, have also taken steps to limit <span id="C177" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>’s <span id="C178" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>influence..</p>

<h2 class="distant">How did <span id="C179" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> respond to <span id="P70" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> election loss?</h2>

<p><span id="P71" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> is the central and heroic figure in <span id="C180" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>’s core narrative — <span id="C181" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the brave patriot who was chosen to save <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="USA" data-label="USA" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> from the global cabal</span>. As a result, most <span id="C182" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> expected that <span id="C183" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">he would easily win re-election, and spend his second term vanquishing the “deep state” and bringing the satanic pedophiles to justice</span>.</p>

<p>After <span id="P72" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span>’s election loss in <span id="D17" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="November 2019">November</span>, many <span id="C184" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> rallied behind the false theory that <span id="C185" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the election was stolen from him</span>. Many <span id="C186" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">expected that on <span id="D18" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="January 2020">Inauguration Day</span>,<span id="P73" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> would not actually leave office as scheduled but would <span id="C187" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">declare martial law, announce mass arrests of Democrats and stop <span id="P74" class="mention person" about="JosephBiden" data-label="Joseph Biden">Joseph Biden</span> from taking office</span></span>.</p>

<p>When <span id="C188" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">that didn’t happen, many <span id="C189" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> grew disillusioned, and some even realized they had been duped</span>. But others continued to <span id="C190" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">believe that “<span id="C191" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">The Storm</span>” was still approaching, and maintained that <span id="P75" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> was still planning a triumphant comeback</span>.</p>

<h2 class="distant">Haven’t there always been <span id="C192" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">far-fetched conspiracy theories about powerful elites</span>?</h2>

<p>It’s true that <span id="C193" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">much of <span id="C194" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>’s subject matter is recycled from earlier <span id="C195" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>, and is rooted in <span id="C196" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic tropes</span> that date back centuries</span>. But <span id="C197" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is fundamentally an <span id="C198" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">internet-based movement</span> that operates in a different way, and at a different scale, than anything we’ve seen before.</p>

<p>For starters, <span id="C199" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is deeply participatory, in a way that few other popular <span id="C200" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> have been. Followers <span id="C201" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">congregate online to decode the latest <span id="P76" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span> posts, <span id="C202" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">discuss their theories about the news of the day</span>, and bond with their fellow believers</span>.<span class="credit"><span id="O30" class="mention organization" about="TheAtlantic" data-label="The Atlantic">The Atlantic</span></span> has called it “the birth of a new religion.”</p>

<p>There’s also the basic danger of <span id="C203" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">what <span id="C204" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> actually believe</span>. It’s one thing to have a <span id="C205" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">polarized political discourse with heated disagreements</span>; it’s another to have <span id="C206" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">millions of Americans who think, with complete sincerity, that the leaders of the <span id="C207" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">opposition party</span> are kidnapping and cannibalizing innocent children</span>.</p>

<p>Combine those <span id="C208" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Anger">violent, paranoid fantasies</span> with the fact that <span id="C209" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> have been <span id="C210" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">charged with committing serious crimes in <span id="P77" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>’s name</span>, and it’s no wonder people are worried.</p>
