<p><span id="P3" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>So I'm <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">Michael Marshall</span> and I'm the project director of the <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="Good Thinking Society" data-label="Good Thinking Society">Good Thinking Society</span></span>, which is a charity based in the <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="United Kingdom" data-label="UnitedKingdom" data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span>. Uh, the whole purpose of our charity is to promote <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">science</span> to challenge <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</span>. So we'll do work, uh, to forward <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Science education">science education</span>. And then another part of the, the work that we do, which is the bulk of my work, is to find <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span> that aren't backed by <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span>  and find people who are promoting those <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span>, find people who are buying into those <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span> and to explore them and figure out if anything can be done to prevent people being confused by them, harmed by them misled by them in those kinds of things. So I spent a lot of my time looking at things like alternative cancer kills and the people who promote those and <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">alternative medicine</span>. I've spent a lot of my time going to see people who say they can  <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">talk to dead</span>. Who say they can do  <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">faith healing</span>.</p>

<p>And then another part of my, uh, my time is spent talking to people who believe in, uh, unusual ideas and who are kind of proponents of them. And that's how I came across the <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> world, uh, is through my, uh, slightly odd, uh, hobby. Uh, at the time before I was working full time as a, as a <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">skeptic</span>, it was a hobby of mine to, um, be in rooms filled with <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">people who disagree</span> with me. To just understand what brings people to <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas that I would look at and say, well, this can't be true</span>. These kinds of <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Belief">fringe and extreme and unusual beliefs</span>. Um, what brings people to believe them and what kind of paths lead people there? What <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span> supports, uh, supports their <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">position in their minds</span> and how do they engage with the world with that worldview and try and have conversations.</p>

<p>I've got a podcast where I talk to people who have kind of <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">fringe beliefs</span> and instead of having a <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversation</span> that a lot of people would have, if they are a <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">skeptic</span> about something and they're talking to a <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believer</span> where you <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anger">shout at them</span> and <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anger">tell them they're wrong</span> and <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">point out all the <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span></span> and <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">tell them</span>, and it gets into quite a volatile <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">discussion</span> sometimes instead of that, I try and have a <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">civil and polite chat</span> to try and explore the gap between us. So I say, I don't believe in this <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">idea of yours</span>, but I'm really interested to figure out why <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">I don't believe it</span> and why <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">you do</span> so <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">let's have a conversation</span>. So I have these kinds of <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">civil discussions</span> and that's kind of how I came across a that the<span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth"> flat earth theory</span> and the idea that there are <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people walking around today who <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">think the world is flat</span></span>.</p>

<p><span id="P5" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:</p>

<p>It's really interesting and serendipitous that we're sitting here because I knew that there was some <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> out there and I just thought it was kind of strange and funny. And about a week ago, I discovered a friend of mine who is very well educated, she's got a doctorate in biochemistry and, uh, she has a sister who's also very intelligent and very well educated. And my friend told me that her sister is a <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and that her sister is very indignant about the, uh, idea that, um, <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">we</span> don't take them seriously. And she said something to the effect of, this is hearsay that we're getting from me right now. That, well, you know, if you looked at the <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">evidence</span>, then you'd know that <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">what you've been told</span> isn't true. So all of a sudden I became fascinated with the <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth people</span> and then just on <span class="credit"><span id="O4" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span> and I hadn't, I had not been a follower of yours until I saw this tweet that somebody I follow must've retweeted a, that you had just given a talk in <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="Edinburgh" data-label="Edinburgh" data-wikidata-id="Q23436">Edinburgh</span> where I had been. And, uh, so I reached out to you and it turns out you live in <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="Liverpool" data-label="Liverpool" data-wikidata-id="Q24826">Liverpool</span> and here I am in <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Liverpool" data-label="Liverpool" data-wikidata-id="Q24826">Liverpool</span> today. So, uh, that's why we're here talking. So tell me what do the <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth people</span>, uh, think and why do they think it?</p>

<p><span id="P6" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>So you've got to sort of unpack that question a little bit because it's very easy for us to see, uh, the <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> as one singular cohesive movement. And that's how I first thought about it when I first came across it in <span id="D1" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> and when I came across the <span class="credit"><span id="O5" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> in the <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="United Kingdom" data-label="UnitedKingdom" data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span>. And so I had a <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversation</span> with the vice president of the <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span>. And I assumed, as you probably have in your mind, that <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe the world is flat</span> think that <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">the world is a disc</span>. And in the center you've got the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span>, then you've got all the continents of the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="World" data-wikidata-id="Q2">World</span> sort of splayed out to fill the circle. And an <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is like the ed<span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> is that not everyone in the flat earth world has that version of the <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="Earth" data-wikidata-id="Q2">World</span> in their heads.</p>

<p>Some do believe <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">it's a disk</span>, but others believe that, yes,<span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">there's <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span> in the middle and there's the land masses around it. And then on <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is the ice around the edge, but instead of it being a discreet disc, some people believe, in fact <span id="L15" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> just goes on forever in all directions</span>. And so they believe that the earth is actually an infinite plane in all directions. That bisect reality, which is a really lovely idea.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P7" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: What does that mean?</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P8" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">So it will go on in North, South, East, West, just go on forever and there is the above and the below, but there's no way of getting from the top to the bottom because it's just infinity of all ice in all directions forever. So there's no way of getting below the earth.</span> And so this was a, when I first came across the <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> in <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> this was quite a <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">vociferous debate</span> that was going on.</p>

<p>And it was quite a schism really. And so they had the, the <span class="credit"><span id="O8" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> at the time, it was largely a forum where they would bring forth <span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">their proofs</span> of <span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">one version of this theory or another</span>. And I also think there's another schism going on in the movement at the time, which is between one side, which are <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who genuinely really believed <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world was flat</span></span>. And <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">the other side, which absolutely did not believe it, but enjoy the intellectual pursuit of arguing a position they need to be false</span>. And so they would find <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">quite esoteric and off the wall proofs that most people wouldn't think of</span>. And so when I first came across it in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> there were people waiting into these arguments who <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">believed the world was round but had never thought about it before, but just assumed in a sort quite an arrogant way that they must know better than anybody who's ever thought about it and come to a different conclusion</span>.</p>

<p>And so they were stomping into these <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">arguments</span> saying, well, <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">what about photos of the earth from space and what about this</span>? And what about <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">ships going over the horizon thinking, well this is the gotcha</span>, but not realizing that those were the first things they'd thought about, that they thought that <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">the world, the approved world's round</span>. And therefore it's probably likely that the <span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who think <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span></span>, I've had the same idea and yet they're still people who think <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span><span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span>, so at least in their mind they must have a good answer to that. That the <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">people who believe <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Round Earth">the world was round</span></span> having these arguments didn't have cause they'd never scrutinized the idea. They rejecting it. And so what was happening was I think to a degree, the part of the schism that were just having fun and knew very well the <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Round Earth">world wasn't flat</span>, but just enjoyed the pursuit of doing that.</p>

<p>They were winning those <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">arguments with people who were coming in and arrogantly assuming that they could answer everything</span>. And in winning those arguments, they were really <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">converting even more people who really believed it</span>. And so you had this kind of effect where it was sort of spiral out of control a little bit, but I think it wasn't, it wasn't viral in the way that in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> as a in the way that it was in <span id="D5" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> and <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="2017">2017</span> and I think part of that is because that <span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Proofs">esoteric off the wall version of proofs can be quite complicated to get your head around</span>. So for example, if you have the <span id="C75" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">disk version</span>, the world and <span id="C76" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">the infinite plane version</span>, both models suffer from an inability to explain <span id="C77" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span>. You don't have a <span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">spherical mass, you don't have a central mass, you don't have a central point pulling it all to one point</span>.</p>

<p>So it's very difficult to explain <span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span> in either one of those models. But these people who were doing kind of <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">esoteric arguments</span> were saying, well, <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">what is gravity? Gravity is an accelerant, falls towards the ground, I think 9.8 meters per second squared, accelerates downward</span>. They said that is identical to a world in which <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the ground accelerates upwards to meet you. And so when you let go of something, it isn't that it's accelerating downwards, it's a, the ground's actually accelerating up to meet it</span>.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P9" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: So it's a form of relativity.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P10" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: This is exactly where they come to. So people would then <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">say, well, <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">if it's, if <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Palne Earth">the ground is the earth is, you know, an infinite plane in all directions that bisects reality and is accelerating upward at 9.8 meters per second squared and always has been since the Dawn of time</span>, you'd hit a problem, which would be the <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">speed of light</span>.</span></span> </p>

<p><span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">You can't go fast. The speed of light</span>. So people don't have a gotcha for this. And so the <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who were putting forth esoteric off the wall trollish arguments</span> would <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">say, well, look at <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="AlbertEinstein" data-label="Albert Einstein">Einstein</span>'s <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Scientifical Theory">theory of relativity</span> <span span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">as you approach Lightspeed, time itself slows down</span> and the maths in their head works back out again. So yes,<span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">we're getting quicker, but time's getting slower and we can account for <span id="C93" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span> in that way</span></span>. And that's quite a complicated idea to get your head around. And so I think the fact that <span id="C94" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">these people were winning arguments was getting, was converting some people to movement, but the way in which they were winning them were keeping people away from the movement because they were quite complex ideas</span>. You couldn't<span id="C95" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social"> stick them on a meme</span> as you can these days. Here's a picture of the earth. You couldn't explain all that stuff about science, the relativity proven gravity and an infinite plane version of the world.</p>

<p>So I think there was a limiting factor going on and that's why when I first came across the <span id="C96" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span>, it was probably still pretty small, pretty unknown. I've been given talks about <span id="C97" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</span> for the last kind of five, six plus years. And I've mentioned that I came across the <span id="C98" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> and people would always say to me, there's nobody who actually believes that nobody actually, they don't really exist, that people are having fun. So it stayed quite small. And then in <span id="D7" class="mention date" about="2015" data-label="2015">2015</span> and <span id="D8" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> a couple of things happened that really ignited a movement. And it was the <span id="C99" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">publishing of two videos on <span class="credit"><span id="O9" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> or two video series on <span class="credit"><span id="O10" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span></span>. Um, one I believe was, uh, <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span>, 200 proofs. The earth is not spending globe. Uh, and the other was <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>'s, uh, uh, 14 videos in his <span id="C100" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> clues series.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P14" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: So now, we're going to actually be <span id="C101" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">converting</span>
 more people.</p>

<p><span id="P15" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>Well, it's, they are genuinely worth looking up because what I found really fascinating about the <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span> 200 proofs, the are 200 of them in there, is that, uh, it was published in <span id="D9" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> so it was three years after we had the, uh, <span id="C102" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">infinite plane</span> and the <span id="C103" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravitational kind of explanation via <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="AlbertEinstein" data-label="Albert Einstein">Einstein</span>'s theory</span> relative to, so it was three years of what you'd expect to be evolution and sophistication and, but in fact, proof number one, <span id="C104" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">the horizon looks flat proof</span>. Number two, <span id="C105" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">even if you go up a mountain, the horizon looks flat</span>. Proof number three, <span id="C106" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">water, uh, cant stick to a curved surface. It always goes level and you can't get it. So there's no way it could stick to a ball</span>. So they're all very, very simplistic arguments. And there's 200 of them. Um, some of them stick to sort of a <span id="C107" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudo physical properties</span>. Others go to a <span id="C108" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>.</p>

<p>So I think proof 199 is saying that, well <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="IsaacNewton" data-label="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</span> and <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="NeilArmstrong" data-label="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</span> and <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="GalileoGalilei" data-label="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</span>, they were all <span id="C110" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">Freemasons</span>. Therefore <span id="C110" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>. And so you have this kind of a, this video and it was also published as a free ebook which collected lots of different so-called proofs of the world being flat that picked from lots of different genre of proof. So if you came to the <span id="C111" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span>, if you, if you were generally interested in <span id="C112" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>, you'd come to it and you'd find enough <span id="C113" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">conspiracy theory reasons</span> to believe <span id="C114" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span> in there. If you came to it because you, uh, placed way too much emphasis on the, uh, the, the, <span id="C115" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">your own powers of observation. You know, you can't show me the curve. I'm looking out at horizon. I can't see the curve. You can't tell me my eyes are wrong</span>. If that's your, your style of thinking.</p>

<p>There were arguments in there for you that would tell you that that would support the idea of <span id="C116" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>. So I think it kind of covered all its bases a little bit. If you came from a <span id="C117" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">fundamentalist Christian perspective</span>, uh, in a <span id="C118" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">biblical literalism</span><span id="C119" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the world is 6,000 years old and created in seven days as per the Bible</span>, uh, which a large part of, of <span id="C120" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> is actually crash <span id="C121" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism</span> in a, in another guys. Um, there were <span id="C122" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">creationist arguments in there that would support, uh, the, the, the idea of the world is flat</span>. So it really did pull together different genre of flat earth arguments into one document. And I think that's why it became quite successful because it had a little bit in for anybody who might be, uh, in any way inclined to doubt the veracity of the round earth theory.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span id="P21" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: That inclination is usually a preexisting condition.</p>

<p><span id="P22" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>I think so. I think so. So a lot of the way that people are stumped, we're coming across this information was through <span class="credit"><span id="O11" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> recommendations. Uh, this is, I think it was a study by the <span class="credit"><span id="O12" class="mention organization" about="AmericanAcademy" data-label="American Academy Of Sciences">American Academy of sciences</span></span> at their last kind of convention, which actually went there. The a scientist went along to the a <span id="L16" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">U.S.</span> flat earth convention and <span id="C123" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">spoke to people there and asked, how did you get into the flat earth movement?</span> And of the 40 people they asked, 39 of them said, I saw it recommended to me on <span class="credit"><span id="O13" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>. And the faulty of said, my son saw it, recommended to him on <span class="credit"><span id="O14" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> and pass it along to me. So it's what's appearing in that right-hand bar of up next on <span class="credit"><span id="O15" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>. So I think when there were people who were looking for moon landing denial videos, <span class="credit"><span id="O16" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>, once these <span id="C124" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">Flat earth videos started getting out there and started having a sensationalist kind of style, so it'd have a sensationalist title</span>, uh, there'd be people, people would come and watch it because they believed it.</p>

<p>Some people watch it cause they thought it was silly. Some people watched it because they wanted to <span id="C125" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">scrutinize it on a point by point basis and watch it five times in a row to really get to the grips of every single argument</span>. So they could write an article about how wrong it is. <span class="credit"><span id="O17" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> at the time said that it didn't say there's three distinct audiences with three distinct agendas. It says there's one audience of three times the size. So this is a pretty good video because loads of people are watching this all the way to the end. And so once <span class="credit"><span id="O17" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> saw that it started recommending it to people. So you'd be watching a video about moon landing denial and <span class="credit"><span id="O18" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> would say, I think someone who's a bit into <span id="C126" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">moon landing denial</span> might also be into the <span id="C127" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth theory</span> and it would float it there as a suggestion.</p>

<p><span id="C128" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">And if people clicked it, that solidified that link a little bit and the more people clicked it, the more that became solidified.</span> And I think that's how a lot of people find their way in. And then it's because it became such a solid link. I think it even went beyond people who are already looking for <span id="C129" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>, uh, ideas. Um, you had people who'd be looking for <span id="C130" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">videos of the, of the earth from space and they might see this video and then then they might watch it</span>. And then that kind of strengthens those relationships. So <span class="credit"><span id="O19" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> had this kind of arguably accidental, I don't think they were deliberately doing it, but had this <span id="C131" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">algorithm</span> that was recommending <span id="C132" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">sensationalist and extreme ideas</span> regularly to people who were searching for things that weren't necessarily about that. And I think that did serve as a, as a <span id="C133" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">recruitment tool</span> and <span id="C134" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">those two videos and the responses to those, those two videos and video series from <span id="P23" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>, <span id="P24" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span>, that really ignited a movement</span> because I think they came around with just the right time or the wrong time in our perspective, uh, that it captured, uh, that <span class="credit"><span id="O20" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> <span id="C135" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">algorithm</span> in full flow.</p>

<p><span id="P25" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:</p>

<p>Uh, so what do just, I'm interested specifically in the videos you say of, uh, the earth from space or the moon. What's the response? Those are all faked?</p>

<p><span id="P26" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>Yeah, pretty much. So, uh, I, I've, I've had lots of <span id="C136" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversations</span> with <span id="C137" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> and when you bring up those visual pieces of evidence, they'll say, well come on, <span id="C138" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">you can't trust visual evidence</span>. And they say photographs for example, <span id="C139" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">you show me a photograph from of the, of the earth from space</span>. <span id="C140" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Alleged Proof">I'll show you a composite job, I'll show you a Photoshop job, I'll show you a hoax</span>. And they'll say that <span id="C141" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof"><span class="credit"><span id="O21" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span></span> even admits that those four photographs are composites, is that, will they are composites</span>. But <span id="C142" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">even if they are, composites, they're composites of what their comes into photos taken from space. It's just they're taken with a camera that isn't far enough away to get the entire earth and in one goal. But you're going to see snapshots of the earth and then you come, you compose those together because you've got a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional object</span>.</p>

<p>You're going to have to sort of stitch those together a little bit, but <span id="C143" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">just cause it's a composite, it's gotta be it composed of something you're saying. It's a composite doesn't throw out the fact that this is actually a genuine photo as well</span>. Um, and so they will talk a lot about how, uh, <span id="C144" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">we can't trust <span class="credit"><span id="O22" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span></span>. That's a big, big part of it. <span class="credit"><span id="O23" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is part of the conspiracy, some lots of the <span id="C145" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> that I've met, I went along to the <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="U.K." data-label="U.K." data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span> <span id="C146" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span> and spent three days in a hotel in <span id="L18" class="mention place" about="Birmingham" data-label="Birmingham" data-wikidata-id="Q2256">Birmingham</span> with 160 <span id="C147" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span>, one of the most genuinely enjoyable weekends of my entire life. Really, really fun. Um, and <span id="C148" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">I went there not to tell them they're wrong and not to be superior, but to really understand what brings people to that movement</span>. Um, but what I heard lots of time was that well, <span class="credit"><span id="O24" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is evil.</p>

<p><span class="credit"><span id="O25" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is a tool of the <span class="credit"><span id="O26" class="mention organization" about="Governement" data-label="Governement">government</span></span>, a tool of the <span class="credit"><span id="O27" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span>, a tool of the new world order. Um, they rely on their budgets so they need to keep that money rolling in, which is why they keep churning out material that suggest the world is round. Um, some people even believe that <span class="credit"><span id="O28" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is a tool of <span id="P27" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span>. Uh, and they have all sorts of convoluted uh, explanations as to why that is. Uh, one of my favorite explanations was one of the speakers at the <span id="C149" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span> an <span id="C150" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Argentinian conspiracy theorist</span> who said, <span id="C151" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">we know for a fact that the <span class="credit"><span id="O29" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a front for the one world order because if you look at the Spanish name for the <span class="credit"><span id="O30" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> , it is the <span class="credit"><span id="O31" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">O N U</span></span>  and if you read that backwards it's U N O which is Spanish for one. And therefore we know for a fact the <span class="credit"><span id="O32" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a, a front for the one world order because the reverse name of it in Spanish is Spanish for one</span>.</p>

<p>And my friend I was at the convention with leftover and said does he realize that<span class="credit"> <span id="O33" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is already French for one?</p>

<p><span id="P28" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: That logic that <span id="C152" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">numerology</span>, when you connect the dots like that is so it's so intriguing.</p>

<p><span id="P29" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: It is. And so they'll see that and they'll say, well, look at the, uh, look at the image, the logo of the <span class="credit"><span id="O34" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> and you have the flat earth, you have the <span id="L19" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span> in the middle, you have all the continents around it. And so let's say, <span id="C153" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why would the <span class="credit"><span id="O35" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> have the flat earth as their logo? If it isn't true that the world is flat?</span> And I had this conversation with the <span id="C154" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and I said, well, what else would you want the <span class="credit"><span id="O36" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span>'s logo to be? And it's, well you could, <span id="C155" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">if the earth is really round, you'd show it from the side</span>.</p>

<p>Okay, but then <span id="C156" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">which countries are you not putting on? Do you want to show <span id="L20" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> and not <span id="L21" class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>? Do you want to show the <span id="L22" class="mention place" about="NorthernHemisphere" data-label="Northern Hemisphere" data-wikidata-id="Q39061">Northern hemisphere</span> and not show <span id="L23" class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q408">Australia</span>? Right?</span> And so he said, well, okay, fine. <span id="C157" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">So you show up from the top. But if that's the case, why isn't that <span id="L24" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> on the <span class="credit"><span id="O37" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span>'s logo, it's missing</span>. And his idea for that is<span id="C158" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> because <span id="L25" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is either the disk around the edge or it's where the dome that surrounds the world is</span>. And <span id="C159" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Expalin">I said, well, <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> isn't a nation. This is the <span class="credit"><span id="O38" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">United Nations</span></span>. It isn't a nation. You know, there's good reasons</span>. If you, if you sort of sense check these ideas, but if you're presented them in a way that says the <span class="credit"><span id="O39" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a front for the <span class="credit"><span id="O40" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span> and the one world order, and here's proof, <span id="C160" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">look at their logo, therefore flat and you're not, then encouraged to sense check your ideas to uh, to look for ways to doubt yourself, to look for ways to disprove your theories rather than looking for evidence that proves them</span>.</p>

<p>You end up in a place where all you're doing is confirming your ideas further and further and further. And this is what we see. We see it in our lives all the time and we're guilty of it all the time. But I think we're guilty of this. This is a movement that's specifically guilty of it.</p>

<p><span id="P30" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: Does Heliocentrism hold and the other planets are flat disks or something as well or are they?</p>

<p><span id="P31" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: yeah, it depends on who you talk. So it's not just that there's the <span id="C161" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">disk version</span> and the <span id="C162" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">infinite plane version</span>. There's actually lots of, there's a myriad of different versions of the, the flat earth and the universe beyond it. So some will believe that we're flat. But the universe around it is pretty much as is, that's quite a niche belief in the flat earth world. Um, some believe that, uh, many believe the sun isn't very far away, so it's very hard to, to uh, justify the solar system as conventional science would have it with a flat earth belief, especially a flat earth belief that may be rooted in <span id="C163" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism and therefore has this kind of earth as the center of everything</span> kind of way.</p>

<p>And you know, <span id="C164" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the sun was created on, on one of the days after the earth, it was already created</span>. And so some of that belief that <span id="C165" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">instead of the sun being millions and millions of miles away, it's actually quite nearby and much smaller</span>. And that's how they account for time differences across, uh, across the world. How you account for seasons, it's just that you're further away from the sun at that point. Um, others believe that <span id="C166" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">the world is a disk, but it's under a dome</span>. Um, which again goes back to the <span id="C167" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">biblical idea of the firmament from and being the roof on top of the world</span>. Um, one of the, one of the, the, uh, piece of evidence I've heard brought, uh, for that, uh, firmament idea for that domed theory. A idea was from <span id="P32" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> who said, uh, if you look at the gravestone of <span id="P33" class="mention person" about="WernerVonBraun" data-label="Werner Von Braun">Werner Von Braun</span>, so <span id="P34" class="mention person" about="WernerVonBraun" data-label="Werner Von Braun">Von Braun</span>, obviously the, uh, the, the Nazi scientist smuggled out of <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> after the second world war by operation paperclip installed towards the head of the <span id="L28" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">U.S.</span> space program. Um, his V2 rocket technology is partly responsible for, for <span id="L29" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> getting into it, getting to the moon first. Um, but if you look on his gravestone, it references <span id="C168" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">Psalms 19</span> one. And if you look up Psalms 19 one, it reads, <span id="C169" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork</span>. So it says <span id="P35" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>, <span id="C170" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Alleged Proof">why would the father of space exploration have on his gravestone a reference to the biblical roof on top of the world, if not a post deathbed confessional? Here's what of saying, there is a firmament and the only way to get me out of <span id="L30" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span>  was to go along with their hoax</span>.</p>

<p>Now I would argue the reference is much more about the first bit of the heavens declare the glory of God for a man who saw his technology has been the key to the heavens. It was the, the way that men put mankind, unlocked the sky. Um, but if you're a <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> or you see that gravestone, and this is proof then that there is a roof on top of the world and if you believe there's a roof on top of the world, then it starts to ask questions about what is space beyond it. And so I spoke to <span id="P36" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> about this and he said, well, <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the sun or moon is still there, but they're much closer and they're separate bodies with their own separate light sources</span>. And the way we know that, he said, it's because <span id="C172" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">sunlight is warm and Moonlight is cold</span>. And I said, <span id="C173" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what do you mean by that</span>?</p>

<p>He said, well, <span id="C174" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">sunlight, obviously warms you. He said, yeah, that wasn't a bit undisputed. Uh, he said, Moonlight. He said, if you go out in the night with a thermometer and you put that in shadow and take a temperature reading, and then you move it away from the shadow into the open clearing and then take a temperature reading, the temperature drops. And that's because the Moonlight is cooling the thermometer down.</span> Well, what's actually happening is <span id="C175" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">your first temperature reading is in shadow and therefore in a shaded area. And then to get into Moonlight, you have to move it out of a shaded area and expose it to whatever, whatever other winds and things you have. And that's a, that's the reason for it"</span>. Um, and so when, my favorite things about <span id="P37" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> 's theory actually is that like many flat earthers, he was a <span id="C176" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">conspiracy theorist</span> who believed in all sorts of <span id="C177" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracies beforehand</span>.</p>

<p>So, uh, <span id="C178" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"><span id="P38" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">JFK</span> was assassinated by the government or by an insight. It was an inside job</span>. <span id="C179" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">The moon landing was never real</span>. Uh, he believed there was a <span id="C180" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">civilization used to live on Mars who carved a face on a rock on Mars</span>. All the, all the kind of classic stuff. And so when I spoke to <span id="P39" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark</span>, I thought one of the ways to try and understand, um, <span id="C181" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what counts as a standard of evidence and how do you sense check? I thought I'd ask him, was there ever a <span id="C182" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span> that you used to believe in that you now no longer believed to be true?</span> And I thought maybe this will help me understand where you can come back from an idea. He said, well, it's funny because I used to, he said, I used to always wonder <span id="C183" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why are all these different conspiracies true</span>? And then I realized <span id="C184" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>.</p>

<p>It all made sense because I thought, <span id="C185" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why did the government killed <span id="P40" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">JFK</span>? It's because they knew that we couldn't get to the moon</span>. So <span id="C186" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the moon landing had to be faked because you can't get past the firmament because the world is flat and under a dome</span>. So he said it was like, um, the, uh, the, the <span id="C187" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">flat earth is kind of the Rosetta stone of <span id="C188" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> to a degree</span>. It makes all the rest of it make sense. But he said there's one thing that no longer makes sense to me because <span id="C189" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">I no longer believe that there's a face on Mars. And I want to meet the guy who came up with that cause I really want to know who's behind him</span>. And I said, yeah, <span id="C190" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">that's cause you no longer believe in Mars. That's cause you believe that the planets and the stars are just projections on the dome. So you have a different view of the universe depending on what version of a, of the flat earth you, uh, you believe in</span>.</p>

<p><span id="P41" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:What are some of the,um, most popular, um, <span id="C191" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>? You know, the, the <span id="C192" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> also believe in, are they <span id="C193" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">anti vacs</span> predominantly?</p>

<p><span id="P42" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:Yeah. So this is where I think it gets quite important for me because, uh, when I spent time at the, at the, the <span id="C194" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span>, when I've talked to <span id="C195" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> and then talk to people who are, you know, <span id="C196" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">scientists and skeptics about it</span>, they all say, well, at least the <span id="C197" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> is harmless. And I think the problem is, uh, the <span id="C198" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> beliefs don't exist in isolation. So one of things that really surprised me actually at the, at the <span id="C199" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">convention</span> that I went to was how little material was about the flat earth. So the Argentinian, uh, <span id="C200" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theorist</span> that was presenting that I mentioned before, he was talking not only was the a one world order and <span class="credit"><span id="O41" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span> that was, you know, run by <span id="P43" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span> and, and various of the tools of <span id="P44" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span>. But he was also pointing out how <span id="C201" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">dinosaurs were faked and how it was a, the dinosaurs were invented by an artist who looked at, who looked at our giraffes and rhinos and crocodiles and sort of mixed the three together to create dinosaurs</span>. But he also said, if you want to know who's really got the, what's really going on behind the world, read the book, the protocols of the <span id="C202" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">elders of Zion</span> and that will tell you what's going on. And</p>

<p><span id="P45" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:</p>

<p>there you go. Now, now you're really at the end. One of the good roots.</p>

<p><span id="P46" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>Totally. And what surprised me was I was shocked to hear this hugely influential <span id="C203" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">antisemitic hoax document</span>. Uh, the protocols, elders designer, a <span id="C204" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">fake that was created to stir antisemitism</span>. I was shocked to hear that brought up on stage at this convention where I was expecting to hear about the flat earth, but I think I was the only one who was shocked. No one else seemed to bat an eyelid. And so we do see these different <span id="C205" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> clustering together. And uh, I spoke to a journalist actually at the, at the convention that weekend and they were having a lovely old time interviewing people saying, Oh, isn't this fun? Isn't it silly? Said, well, it is fun, but if you really want to know what's going on, just see that couple over there with the baby. <span id="C206" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">Ask them if the baby's vaccinated, ask them in that baby was ill tomorrow</span>.</p>

<p><span id="C207" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">Would they go and see a doctor or would they believe that big pharma is a tool of oppression and evil and moneymaking, all this kind of stuff</span>. You know, one of the speakers at the <span id="C208" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">convention</span>, as well as being a <span id="C209" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and as well as being a <span id="C210" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">nine 11 truther</span> also believes that <span id="C211" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">you can cure all manner of diseases, including HIV and AIDS by drinking or injecting your own urine</span>. And this is, these are ideas, these are the ideas that are sort of bedfellows. And so I think a flat earth is in some ways, it's just the most visible of a, an ecosystem of conspiracy theory. Uh, and I think if you really want to try and, uh, help people challenge their own beliefs in the flat earth, you have to see it as such. You can't see it in isolation. You have to try and look at the, the wider pattern that it fits within.</p>

<p><span id="P47" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:</p>

<p>Uh, this is so fascinating. Um, and you're obviously a tremendous talker. So why don't you, why don't you promote your podcast.</p>

<p><span id="P48" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:</p>

<p>I've got a couple of things that I do, but the one in which <span id="C212" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">I talk to people who, uh, who put forward ideas that I disagree with is called be reasonable with the idea being that I'm there to be reasonable to put forward a reasonable face to it. And so, um, I've talked to all manner of people from <span id="C213" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe the world is flat</span> to <span id="C214" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Hollow Earth">people who believe the world is hollow</span></span>. I wish that's a really interesting interview because that goes in places in, in, in the same way that you might not associate, uh, <span id="C215" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">antisemitic hoaxes</span> with the <span id="C216" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth belief</span>. The <span id="C217" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Hollow Earth">hollow earth belief</span> goes into some of the key risk positions too. And that's well worth the listen. Um, and <span id="C218" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">I've interviewed people who believe they can <span id="C219" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">talk to the dead</span> and, and many of the things like that. But I've also interviewed people who are promoting, uh, the <span id="C220" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">drinking of bleach as a cure for cancer</span>, uh, and people who are putting forward <span id="C221" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">white supremacists beliefs</span>, uh, <span id="C222" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">anti-feminist beliefs </span> and some pretty extreme positions</span>.</p>

<p>And the, the, the idea of the show really is to kind of understand the way we as people structure our beliefs. Cause I think the structuring of belief is very, uh, is very similar. The details of the beliefs change. And I think that <span id="C223" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> is a, is a great way of examining the, the, the nature of belief, um, untainted by the possibility that it might be true. And then once you, <span id="C224" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">once you really examine that and understand that once you've understood that the factors that influence people's beliefs, you can sort of lift that entire framework up and then lay it over some of these other beliefs that are much harder to point to a single fact that disproves it</span>. So I think, yeah, understanding people who hold fringe or extreme positions is a useful thing. If we want to <span id="C225" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">try and limit their influence and bring people back to a more <span id="C226" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">reasonable position</span></span>.</p>

<p><span id="P49" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:</p>

<p>And, of course, bleach is back in the news, as some people have been recommending it as an anti-coronavirus gargle. Do not, under any circumstances, do that.</p>
