                                <p>It has been a long, lazy few months, with plans put on hold by the pandemic.

One visiting priest astutely suggested <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="Heidi" data-label="Heidi">Heidi</span>’s new-found vocation was no coincidence: <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="Trosetvola" data-label="Trosetvola" data-wikidata-id="Q31234084">Troset</span> translates as “belief place”.</p>

                                <p>Serendipity also guided entrepreneurs <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="FrodeSakshaug" data-label="Frode Sakshaug">Frode</span> and <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="KristineSakshaug" data-label="Kristine Sakshaug">Kristine Sakshaug</span> in the construction of their <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Building">Oyna landscape hotel</span> in <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Inderoy" data-label="Inderoy" data-wikidata-id="Q488970">Inderoy</span>, a 50-minute drive north.

                                <p>Launching in the middle of a pandemic was challenging, but with lockdown rules eased for Norwegians a couple of weeks after the hotel opened, it has been almost fully booked ever since.</p>

                                <p>Solidarity has glued this community together. <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="FrodeSakshaug" data-label="Frode Sakshaug">Frode</span>, who grew up and played on the land where his hotel now sits, employed <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">local businesses for construction</span> and eschewed lucrative deals to work with an investor he knows and trusts. He constantly talks about “we” and “us”. It’s a reminder that money isn’t the only motivation in life.</p>

                                <p>Further north, on <span id="L28" class="mention place" about="Stokkoya" data-label="Stokkoya" data-wikidata-id="Q6979467">Stokkoya</span>, an island in the <span id="L29" class="mention place" about="NorwegianSea" data-label="Norwegian Sea" data-wikidata-id="Q47545">Norwegian Sea</span>, <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="TorildLangklopp" data-label="Torild Langklopp">Torild Langklopp</span> and <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="RoarSvenning" data-label="Roar Svenning">Roar Svenning</span> have spent almost two decades building a <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Community Contribution">social enterprise to benefit their community</span>.

                                <p>“During the pandemic, we went out fishing most days,” reminisces <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="RoarSvenning" data-label="Roar Svenning">Roar</span> that evening, as chefs prepare our catch a few sandy feet from the lapping waves. “We had everything we needed.”</p>

                                <p>As we talk, I’m swept up in their tidal wave of innovative ideas: <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Leisure">jazz concerts on the rocks, moonlit dancers emerging from the surf, and a philosophy for a new way of existence</span>. <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">Our thinking cogs are oiled with shots of Granskauen gin, distilled by local barman <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="DustinZimmerman" data-label="Dustin Zimmerman">Dustin Zimmerman</span> and his partner <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="MarenGrotte" data-label="Maren Grotte">Maren Grotte</span>.

                                <p>Like so many products made in the countryside, Granskauen is served in the city, too.

In the absence of masks and Plexiglass screens, bottles of sanitiser are the only reminder of a pandemic from which <span id="L32" class="mention place" about="Norway" data-label="Norway" data-wikidata-id="Q20">Norway</span> has escaped relatively unscathed. <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">Perhaps it is the high standard of living, the clean air or the amount of space, but life generally feels happier and healthier here</span>. That thought stays with me as I take a final train journey two hours south to <span id="L33" class="mention place" about="Oppdal" data-label="Oppdal" data-wikidata-id="Q113595">Oppdal</span>, to meet the area’s oldest resident: the <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">muskox</span>.</p>
