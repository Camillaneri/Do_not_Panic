		<p class="intro midSmall">IN the second part of our trilogy on <span id="L1" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scottish</span> eccentrics as portrayed by <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="HughMacDiarmid" data-label="Hugh MacDiarmid">Hugh MacDiarmid</span> (<span id="P5" class="mention person" about="ChristopherMurray" data-label="Christopher Murray">Christopher Murray</span> Grieve) we approach with some trepidation one of the <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="fame">most famous</span> – or should that be <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">infamous</span> – figures in all of <span id="L2" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scottish</span> literature. Well, <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkDislike" data-label="Dislike">if you can call <span id="P6" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">William Topaz McGonagall</span>’s output literature …</span></p>

		<p>Championed by such comedic geniuses as <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="SpikeMilligan" data-label="Spike Milligan">Spike Milligan</span>, who starred as <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> opposite <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="PeterSellers" data-label="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</span> as <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="QueenVictoria" data-label="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</span> – yes, you read that correctly – in the <span id="D1" class="mention date" about="1974" data-label="1974">1974</span> film <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="Movie" data-label="The Great McGonagall">The Great <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span></span>, the man renowned as <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">the world’s worst poet</span> was basically a man who wrote <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Uncertain">funny poems</span>. What made him even funnier was the fact he didn’t think they were funny – <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">he took himself so seriously that he really did think he was up there with <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="RabbieBurns" data-label="Rabbie Burns">Rabbie Burns</span></span>.</p>
		 
		<p><span id="P13" class="mention person" about="HughMacDiarmid" data-label="Hugh MacDiarmid">MacDiarmid</span> does him the justice of trying to take <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> seriously, beginning his essay thus: “<span id="P15" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">William McGonagall</span> was not a <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="AutorsOfBadLiterature" data-label="Unaware">bad poet</span>; still less a <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Ironic">good bad poet</span>. He was <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Discourse">not a poet at all</span>, and that he has become synonymous with <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">bad poetry</span> in <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span> is only a natural consequence of <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scottish</span> insensitivity to the <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Discourse">qualities alike of good poetry and of bad</span>.</p>


		<p>There is so much that is <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">bad</span> in all the poetry that <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="Nationality" data-label="Scottish">Scots people</span> know and admire that it is not surprising that for their pet example of a <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Ironic">good bad poet</span> they should have had to go <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Discourse">outside the range of poetry, good, bad, or indifferent, altogether</span>.</p>

		<p>“<span id="P16" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> is in a very special category, and has it entirely to himself. There are no other writings known to me that resemble his. So far as the whole tribe of <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="Autor" data-label="Recognized">poets</span> is concerned, from the <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Sincere">veritable lords of language</span> to <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="AutorsOfBadLiterature" data-label="Unaware">the worst doggerel-mongers</span>, he stands alone, ‘neither fish, flesh, nor good red-herring,’ and certainly his ‘works’ will be searched in vain for any of <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">those ludicrous triumphs of anti-climax, those devastating incongruities, which constitute the weird and wonderful qualities of bad verse</span>.”</p>


		<p><span id="P17" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> was not the first and certainly not the last of a long line of “<span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="Nationality" data-label="Scottish">Scottish</span> <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="AutorsOfBadLiterature" data-label="Unaware">bad poets</span>”. Born in <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="1825" data-label="1825">1825</span>, we know precious little about his early life as he appears to have faked his birthplace as <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="Edinburgh" data-label="Edinburgh" data-wikidata-id="Q23436">Edinburgh</span> when it is more probable that his <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="Nationality" data-label="Irish">Irish</span> parents brought him to <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span> as a youngster.</p>

		<p>The family moved to <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span> when <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> was about 14, and he was apprenticed into the textile industry to follow in his father’s footsteps as a handloom weaver. He was an autodidact, reading reams of literature and entertaining his fellow weavers with recitations of <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="WilliamShakespeare" data-label="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</span> – he paid a theatre owner to let him play the role of <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="FictionalCaracter" data-label="Macbeth">Macbeth</span> and refused to die in the final scene as he had a grudge against the actor playing <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="FictionalCaracter" data-label="Macduff">Macduff</span>.</p>

		<p>He married a fellow mill worker, <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="Jean King" data-label="Jean King">Jean King</span>, and they had seven children in all. It was the eldest daughter’s misfortune to have an illegitimate child – then an event which brought opprobrium on an entire family – in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="1877" data-label="1877">1877</span>, and it provoked a mid-life crisis for <span id="P21" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> who suddenly announced he was going to be a <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="Autor" data-label="Recognized">full-time poet</span>.</p>


		<p>He was soon printing his <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">execrable verses</span> and took to the stage where <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkDislike" data-label="Dislike">audiences didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and hurled abuse and fruit and vegetables at him</span>.</p>

		<p>We know what he looked like as <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span> bookseller <span id="P22" class="mention person" about="LowdenMacartney" data-label="Lowden Macartney">Lowden Macartney</span>, who edited <span id="P23" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span>’s poetry collections, tells us: “He was a strange, weird, drab figure, and suggested more than anything else a broken-down actor. He wore his hair long and sheltered it with a wide-rimmed hat. His clothes were always shabby, and even in summer he refused to discard his overcoat. He had a solemn, sallow face, with heavy features and eyes of the sort termed fish-like.”</p>


		<p><span id="P24" class="mention person" about="HughMacDiarmid" data-label="Hugh MacDiarmid">MacDiarmid</span> is even more scathing about the poet and his home city blaming his delusions on “his laziness, his peasant conceit (carried, of course, to an absolutely abnormal length), and the fact that he lived in <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span>”.</p>

		<p>He adds: “<span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span> was then and has since been the great home and fostering centre of the <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">cheapest popular literature in <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span></span>, and huge fortunes have been built up there on precisely the chief ingredients of <span id="P25" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span>’s art – mindlessness, snobbery, and the inverted snobbery of a false cult of proletarian writers.</p>


		<p>“So far as literature has been concerned, the idea of <span id="P26" class="mention person" about="RabbieBurns" data-label="Rabbie Burns">Burns</span> as a ‘ploughman poet’ has been fatal. <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span> has suffered since from an endless succession of <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Discourse">railwayman poets</span>, <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="AutorApreciation" data-label="Discourse">policeman poets</span>, and the like. The movement was in full swing when <span id="P27" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> was caught up in it.”</p>

		<p><span id="P28" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> often simply rewrote newspaper stories in a kind of verse. Thus we have <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="The Famous Tay Whale"> The Famous Tay Whale</span>.</p>
		<div class="italic">
		<p>“Twas in the month of December,</p>

		<p>and in the year of 1883,</p>

		<p>That a monster whale came to <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span>,</p>

		<p>Resolved for a few days to sport and play,</p>

		<p>And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay …</p>

		<p>And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,</p>

		<p>No matter what other people may think or what is their creed…</p>

		<p>Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,</p>

		<p>And has brought it to <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span> all safe and all sound;</p>

		<p>Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,</p>

		<p>So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.</p>

		<p>Then hurrah for the mighty monster whale,</p>

		<p>Which has got 17 feet 4 inches, from tip to tip, of a tail;</p>

		<p>Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,</p>

		<p>That is to say, if the people are all willing.”</p>

		<p>His most <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="fame">famous</span>, or <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">infamous</span> poem concerned a disaster when the <span id="L15" class="mention place" about="Tay" data-label="Tay" data-wikidata-id="Q19719">Tay</span> Railway Bridge collapsed in a storm.</p>

		<p>Here’s an excerpt, but seek out the full length version to <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Ironic">appreciate its awfulness</span>.</p>

		<p>“Beautiful Railway Bridge of the Silv’ry Tay!</p>


		<p>Alas! I am very sorry to say</p>

		<p>That ninety lives have been taken away</p>

		<p>On the last Sabbath day of 1879,</p>

		<p>Which will be remember’d for a very long time.</p>

		<p>‘Twas about seven o’clock at night,</p>

		<p>And the wind it blew with all its might,</p>

		<p>And the rain came pouring down,</p>

		<p>And the dark clouds seem’d to frown,</p>

		<p>And the Demon of the air seem’d to say-</p>

		<p>‘I’ll blow down the Bridge of Tay’.</p>

		<p>So the train mov’d slowly along the Bridge of Tay,</p>

		<p>Until it was about midway,</p>

		<p>Then the central girders with a crash gave way,</p>

		<p>And down went the train and passengers into the Tay!</p>

		<p>The Storm Fiend did loudly bray,</p>

		<p>Because ninety lives had been taken away,</p>

		<p>On the last Sabbath day of 1879,</p>

		<p>Which will be remember’d for a very long time.”</p>

		<p>McGonagall compounded the felony by penning a tribute to the re-built bridge:</p>

		<p>“Beautiful new railway bridge of the silvery Tay,</p>

		<p>With your strong brick piers and buttresses in so grand array,</p>

		<p>And your thirteen central girders, which seems to my eye</p>

		<p>Strong enough all windy storms to defy.</p>

		<p>And as I gaze upon thee my heart feels gay,</p>

		<p>Because thou art the greatest railway bridge of the present day,</p>

		<p>And can be seen for miles away,</p>

		<p>From north, south, east, or west, of the Tay.”</p>
		</div>

		<p>AT one point he wrote to <span id="P28" class="mention person" about="QueenVictoria" data-label="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</span>, to whom he was devoted, to present her with some of his works. A flunkey wrote back thanking him for his interest, which was all the excuse <span id="P29" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> needed – he walked from <span id="L16" class="mention place" about="Dundee" data-label="Dundee" data-wikidata-id="Q123709">Dundee</span> to <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="Balmoral" data-label="Balmoral" data-wikidata-id="Q42049">Balmoral</span>, presented himself at the door as “the <span id="P30" class="mention person" about="QueenVictoria" data-label="Queen Victoria">Queen</span>’s poet” only to be sent away and told she already had one – <span id="P31" class="mention person" about="LordTennyson" data-label="Lord Tennyson">Alfred</span>, <span id="P32" class="mention person" about="LordTennyson" data-label="Lord Tennyson">Lord Tennyson</span>.</p>

		<p>The “<span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkAppreciation" data-label="Uncertain">poetry</span>” flowed out, and <span id="P33" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> kept on performing them, <span id="P34" class="mention person" about="HughMacDiarmid" data-label="Hugh MacDiarmid">MacDiarmid</span> concluding that he was “<span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">genuinely incapable of realising or being persuaded that his poems were not at least as good as any ever written – with the possible exception of Shakespeare’s – and he did not hesitate to proclaim the fact</span>.”</p>

		<p>Moving to <span id="L18" class="mention place" about="Edinburgh" data-label="Edinburgh" data-wikidata-id="Q23436">Edinburgh</span>, he was taken up by a group of friends who supported the increasingly penniless <span id="P35" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> in forays to <span id="L19" class="mention place" about="London" data-label="London" data-wikidata-id="Q84">London</span> and <span id="L20" class="mention place" about="NewYork" data-label="New York" data-wikidata-id="Q60">New York</span>. Needless to say, his works did not travel well and he was soon back in <span id="L21" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span> performing and <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkDislike" data-label="Dislike">being heckled and abused</span>.</p>

		<p>He had cruel tricks played upon him – a fake <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="OnoraryTitleAward" data-label="Ironic">“Order of the White Elephant” knighthood</span> was conferred upon him, purportedly by “representatives” of the <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="FictitiousPerson" data-label="King of Burma">King of Burma</span>. He took it seriously, of course, and called himself <span id="P36" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">Sir William Topaz</span> <span id="P37" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> thereafter. <span id="P38" class="mention person" about="WilliamPower" data-label="William Power">William Power</span>, in his book <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="My Scotland">My <span id="L22" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q22">Scotland</span></span>, described a performance in <span id="L23" class="mention place" about="Scotland" data-label="Scotland" data-wikidata-id="Q4093">Glasgow</span>: “He wore a Highland dress of <span id="P39" class="mention person" about="RobRoy" data-label="Rob Roy">Rob Roy</span> tartan and boy’s size. After reciting some of his own poems, to an accompaniment of <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="ArtworkDislike" data-label="Dislike">whistles and cat-calls</span>, the Bard armed himself with a most dangerous-looking broadsword, and strode up and down the platform, declaiming ‘<span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Clarence’s Dream">Clarence’s Dream</span>’ and ‘<span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="Give me another horse – Bind up my wounds">Give me another horse – Bind up my wounds</span>’.</p>

		<p>“His voice rose to a howl. He thrust and slashed at imaginary foes. A shower of apples and oranges fell on the platform. Almost before they touched it, they were met by the fell edge of <span id="P40" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span>’s claymore and cut to pieces. The Bard was beaded with perspiration and orange juice. The audience yelled with delight; <span id="P41" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> yelled louder still with a fury I fancy was not wholly feigned.”</p>

		<p>MacDiarmid wrote that <span id="P42" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> became “<span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="fame" data-label="infamy">a national joke</span>”, adding: “<span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="AutorSelfPerception" data-label="Absolute confidence">His claims to be superior to every other poet, with the sole exception of Shakespeare</span>, were in all the papers – with samples of his <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">indescribable doggerel</span>.</p>

		<p>“Ludicrous incidents were invented – like his attempted interview with <span id="P43" class="mention person" about="QueenVictoria" data-label="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</span> at <span id="L24" class="mention place" about="Balmoral" data-label="Balmoral" data-wikidata-id="Q42049">Balmoral</span>; and most of his alleged sayings and poems ... (certainly all of these which show the slightest wit or advance his claims in a super-Shavian fashion) were invented by his baiters.</p>

		<p>“The way in which <span id="P44" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span>’s effusions were thrown off in penny broadsides makes anything like a collection of authentic examples at this time of day impossible. But the genuine <span id="P45" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span> article is fairly easily distinguishable from the far too farcically funny efforts fathered upon him. There is nothing superficially funny about his authentic productions at all – they are all dead serious.”</p>

		<p>Like this one: <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="LiteraryWork" data-label="The Attempted Assassination of the Queen">The Attempted Assassination of the <span id="P46" class="mention person" about="QueenVictoria" data-label="Queen Victoria">Queen</span></span>.</p>
		<div class="italic">
		<p>“God prosper long our noble Queen, And long may she reign.</p>

		<p>Maclean he tried to shoot her, but it was all in vain.</p>

		<p>For God he turned the ball aside, Maclean aimed at her head, And he felt very angry because he didn’t shoot her dead.</p>

		<p>Maclean must be a madman, which is obvious to be seen,</p>

		<p>Or else he wouldn’t have tried to shoot our most beloved Queen.”</p>
		</div>

		<p>In his 70s, <span id="P47" class="mention person" about="WilliamMcGonagall" data-label="William McGonagall">McGonagall</span>’s health declined and his <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="OpinionOnArtwork" data-label="Bad">poetry got even worse</span>. He died penniless in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="1902" data-label="1902">1902</span> and was buried in an unmarked grave in Greyfriars Kirkyard in <span id="L25" class="mention place" about="Edinburgh" data-label="Edinburgh" data-wikidata-id="Q23436">Edinburgh</span>.</p>

		<p><span id="P48" class="mention person" about="William Power" data-label="William Power">William Power</span> later wrote: “He added to the gaiety of at least one nation, and, as the Ossian of the ineffably absurd, he has entered upon <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="literarySuccess" data-label="Ironic paradoxical">immortality</span>.”</p>
