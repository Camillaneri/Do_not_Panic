								<p class="distant">By now, youâve probably heard of <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>, the internet <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span> that has <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">taken hold</span> among many on the <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">American right</span>.</p>

								<p>But you may still have questions about what exactly is going on.</p>

								<p><span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> was once a fringe phenomenon â the kind most people could safely ignore. But recently, it has gone mainstream. In <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="2020">2020</span>, <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer"><span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> supporters</span> <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Fake News">flooded social media with false information</span> about <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">Covid-19</span>, the <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">Black Lives Matter protests</span> and the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">presidential election</span>, and <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">recruited legions of new believers to their ranks</span>. A December <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">poll</span> by <span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="NPR" data-label="NPR">NPR </span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="Ipsos" data-label="Ipsos">Ipsos</span></span> found that <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">17 percent of Americans</span> believed that the core falsehood of <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> â that â<span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> group of Satan-worshiping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media</span>aâ â was true.</p>

								<p><span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also seeped into the offline world. <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Followers of the movement</span> participated in the deadly <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"> Capitol riot</span> in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="January">January</span>, and other <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> have been <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">charged with violent crimes, including kidnappings, assassination plots and the <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="2019">2019</span> murder of a mafia boss in <span id="L1" class="mention place" about="NewYork" data-label="New York" data-wikidata-id="Q60">New York</span></span>.

								<p><span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also made inroads in <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Republican</span> politics.

Elected <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Republicans</span> at the state and local levels have also <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">expressed support</span> for <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is an incredibly convoluted theory, and you could fill an entire book explaining its various tributaries and subtheories. But here are some basic things you should know.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">What is <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>?</h2>

								<p><span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is the umbrella term for a set of internet conspiracy theories that allege, falsely, that <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> believe that <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">this cabal includes top <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">Democrats</span> like <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="JosephBiden" data-label="Joseph Biden">President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</span>, <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</span>, <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="BarackObama" data-label="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</span> and <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="GeorgeSoros" data-label="George Soros">George Soros</span>, as well as a number of entertainers and <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Hollywood" data-label="Hollywood" data-wikidata-id="Q34006">Hollywood</span> celebrities like <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="OprahWinfrey" data-label="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</span>, <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="TomHanks" data-label="Tom Hanks">Tom Hanks</span> and <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="EllenDeGeneres" data-label="Ellen DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</span> and religious figures including <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="PopeFrancis" data-label="Pope Francis">Pope Francis</span> and <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DalaiLama" data-label="Dalai Lama">the Dalai Lama</span></span>. Many of them also believe that, <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">in addition to molesting children, members of this group kill and eat their victims to extract a life-extending chemical called adrenochrome</span>.</p>

								<p>According to <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon lore</span>, <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">former <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">President Donald J. Trump</span> was recruited by top military generals to run for president in <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> to break up this criminal conspiracy and bring its members to justice. Many of these cabal members will soon be arrested, the theory goes, and some will be imprisoned at <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="GuantÃ¡namoBay" data-label="GuantÃ¡namo Bay" data-wikidata-id="Q208035">GuantÃ¡namo Bay</span>, while others will face military tribunals and be executed</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">Is that all?</h2>

								<p>Not by a long shot. Since it began, <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has incorporated elements of many <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">other conspiracy theorycommunities</span>, including <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">claims about the assassination of <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</span>, <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the existence of U.F.O.s</span>, and the <span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">9/11 âtrutherâ movement</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">QAnon Anonymous, a podcast</span> about the <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon movement</span>, calls <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> a <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">âbig tent conspiracy theoryâ</span> because it is constantly evolving and adding new features and claims. But the <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">existence of a global pedophile cabal</span> is the core tenet of <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>, and the one that <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">most, if not all, of its followers</span> believe.</p>

								<p>Since the <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="D7" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="2020">2020</span> election</span>, <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also become a stronghold of support for the <span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">false theory that the election was stolen from <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span></span>. Some <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> maintain that <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">he is still the lawful president</span>, although some have reluctantly accepted <span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">the reality that he is not</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">How did this all start?</h2>

								<p>In <span id="D8" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="2017">October 2017</span>, a <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">post</span> appeared on <span class="credit"><span id="O5" class="mention organization" about="4chan" data-label="4chan">4chan</span></span>, the notoriously toxic message board, from an <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">anonymous account</span> calling itself <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">âQ Clearance Patriotâ</span>. This poster, who became known simply as <span id="P21" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">âQâ</span>, claimed to be a <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">high-ranking government insider with access to classified information about <span id="P22" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span>âs war against the global cabal</span></p>

								<p><span id="P23" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">âQâ</span> predicted that <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">this war would soon culminate in <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">âThe Stormâ</span> â an appointed time when <span id="P23" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> would finally unmask the cabal, punish its members for their crimes and restore <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="USA" data-label="USA" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> to greatness</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">Why is it called â<span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">âThe Stormâ</span>â?</h2>

								<p class="left">Itâs a reference to a cryptic remark <span id="P26" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> made during an <span id="D10" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="October 2017">October 2017</span> photo op. Posing alongside military generals, <span id="P27" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> said, â<span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">You guys know what this represents? Maybe itâs the calm before the storm</span>.â</p>

								<p><span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> pointed to this moment as <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">proof that<span id="P28" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> was sending coded messages about his plans to break up the global cabal</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">Who is <span id="P29" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>, and what are <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">âQ Dropsâ</span>?</h2>

								<p><span id="P30" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs identity is still unknown, although there have been <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">hints and speculation</span> about it for years. Some speculate that <span id="C83" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">a single internet troll has been <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">posting</span> as <span id="P31" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span> the entire time</span>; others say that <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">multiple people are involved in <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">posting</span> as <span id="P32" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span></span>, or that <span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"><span id="P33" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs identity has changed over time</span>.</p>

								<p>Making things more complicated is that <span id="P34" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs online home base has changed several times. <span id="P35" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs posts originally appeared on <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="4chan" data-label="4chan">4chan</span></span>. Then they moved to <span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="8chan" data-label="8chan">8chan</span></span>, where they stayed until <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">that site was taken offline last year after the <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="L6" class="mention place" about="ElPaso" data-label="El Paso" data-wikidata-id="Q16562">El Paso</span> mass shooting</span></span>. They now live on <span class="credit"><span id="O8" class="mention organization" about="8kun" data-label="8kun">8kun</span></span>, a site run by the former owner of <span class="credit"><span id="O9" class="mention organization" about="8chan" data-label="8chan">8chan</span></span>. Each of these sites uses a <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anonymity">system of identity verification known as a âtripcodeâ â essentially, a username that proves that a series of anonymous posts were written by the same person or people</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">âDropsâ"</span>" are what <span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> call <span id="P36" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs posts. There have been nearly 5,000 of them so far, and most take the form of a cryptic coded message.</p>

Unlike the stereotypes of extremist movements, <span id="C133" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> doesnât appear to be primarily dominated by young men, or people experiencing economic pain.

								<p><span id="C135" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also developed an international presence, and has been embraced by <span id="C136" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">conspiracy theorists</span> and <span id="C137" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">far-right extremists</span> in countries including the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">United Kingdom</span>, <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> and <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Japan" data-label="Japan" data-wikidata-id="Q17">Japan</span>.</p>

								<p>Yes and no. <span id="C140" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has been described as a âbig-budget sequelâ to <span id="C141" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>, because it takes the original <span id="C142" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate conspiracy theory</span> â which alleged, falsely, that <span id="C143" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> <span id="P65" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton<">Mrs. Clinton</span> and her cronies were operating a child sex-trafficking ring out of the basement of a <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="DC" data-label="Washington D.C." data-wikidata-id="Q61">Washington, DC</span>, pizza restaurant</span> â and adds many more layers of narrative on top of it. But <span id="C144" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">many people believe in both theories</span>, and for many <span id="C145" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span>, <span id="C146" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> was a kind of gateway to the larger world of <span id="C147" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">right-wing <span id="C148" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>.</p>

								<p>One new element in <span id="C149" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is a number of <span id="C150" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">clear and specific predictions about when and how â<span id="C151" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">The Storm</span>â would play out</span>.

								<p><span id="C153" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">None of those predictions came true</span>. But most <span id="C154" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> didnât care.

								<h2 class="distant">Why are some people attracted to the <span id="C155" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon movement</span>?</h2>

								<p>A common misconception is that <span id="C156" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is purely a political movement. But it functions, for <span id="C157" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe in it</span>, as both <span id="C158" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">a social community and a source of entertainment</span>.</p>

								<p>Some people have compared <span id="C159" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> to a massive multiplayer online game, because of the way it <span id="C160" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">invites participants to cocreate a kind of shared reality filled with recurring characters, shifting story lines and intricate puzzle-solving quests</span>. <span id="C161" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> has also been compared to a church, in that it <span id="C162" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">provides its followers with a social support structure as well as an organizing narrative for their everyday lives</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="P68" class="mention person" about="AdrianHon" data-label="Adrian Hon">Adrian Hon</span>, a game designer who has written about <span id="C163" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>âs similarity to alternate-reality games, says that believers â<span id="C164" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">open a fascinating fantasy world of secret wars and cabals and <span id="P69" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</span> controlling things, and it offers convenient explanations for things that feel inexplicable or wrong about the world</span>.â</p>

								<h2 class="distant">What role have <span id="C165" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">social networks</span> played in <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>âs popularity?</h2>

								<p>Even though <span id="C166" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">Qâs posts</span> appear on <span id="C167" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">fringe message boards</span>, the <span id="C168" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon phenomenon</span> owes much of its popularity to <span class="credit"><span id="O21" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span>, <span class="credit"><span id="O22" class="mention organization" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook">Facebook</span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O23" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>, which have <span id="C169" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">amplified <span id="C170" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> messages and recommended <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> groups and pages to new people through their algorithms</span>.</p>

								<p>In recent months, many leading social networks have taken steps to ban <span id="C172" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> content from their services, citing the theoryâs potential for offline harm. In <span id="D16" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="October 2019">October</span>, <span class="credit"><span id="O24" class="mention organization" about="Facebook" data-label="Facebook">Facebook</span></span> and <span class="credit"><span id="O25" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> both announced <span id="C173" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">wide-ranging <span id="C174" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> bans, and removed thousands of accounts, pages, and channels from their platforms</span>. <span class="credit"><span id="O26" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span> has <span id="C175" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">banned thousands of <span id="C176" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> accounts for engaging in coordinated harassment</span>.

								<h2 class="distant">How did <span id="C179" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> respond to <span id="P70" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> election loss?</h2>

								<p><span id="P71" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> is the central and heroic figure in <span id="C180" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>âs core narrative â <span id="C181" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the brave patriot who was chosen to save <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="USA" data-label="USA" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> from the global cabal</span>. As a result, most <span id="C182" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> expected that <span id="C183" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">he would easily win re-election, and spend his second term vanquishing the âdeep stateâ and bringing the satanic pedophiles to justice</span>.</p>

								<p>After <span id="P72" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span>âs election loss in <span id="D17" class="mention date" about="2019" data-label="November 2019">November</span>, many <span id="C184" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> rallied behind the false theory that <span id="C185" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the election was stolen from him</span>. Many <span id="C186" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">expected that on <span id="D18" class="mention date" about="2020" data-label="January 2020">Inauguration Day</span>,<span id="P73" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> would not actually leave office as scheduled but would <span id="C187" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Political Act">declare martial law, announce mass arrests of Democrats and stop <span id="P74" class="mention person" about="JosephBiden" data-label="Joseph Biden">Joseph Biden</span> from taking office</span></span>.</p>

								<p>When <span id="C188" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">that didnât happen, many <span id="C189" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon believers</span> grew disillusioned, and some even realized they had been duped</span>. But others continued to <span id="C190" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">believe that â<span id="C191" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event">The Storm</span>â was still approaching, and maintained that <span id="P75" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Mr. Trump</span> was still planning a triumphant comeback</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="distant">Havenât there always been <span id="C192" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">far-fetched conspiracy theories about powerful elites</span>?</h2>

								<p>Itâs true that <span id="C193" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">much of <span id="C194" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span>âs subject matter is recycled from earlier <span id="C195" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>, and is rooted in <span id="C196" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic tropes</span> that date back centuries</span>. But <span id="C197" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is fundamentally an <span id="C198" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">internet-based movement</span> that operates in a different way, and at a different scale, than anything weâve seen before.</p>

								<p>For starters, <span id="C199" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="QAnon">QAnon</span> is deeply participatory, in a way that few other popular <span id="C200" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> have been. Followers <span id="C201" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">congregate online to decode the latest <span id="P76" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span> posts, <span id="C202" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">discuss their theories about the news of the day</span>, and bond with their fellow believers</span>.<span class="credit"><span id="O30" class="mention organization" about="TheAtlantic" data-label="The Atlantic">The Atlantic</span></span> has called it âthe birth of a new religion.â</p>

								<p>Thereâs also the basic danger of <span id="C203" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">what <span id="C204" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> actually believe</span>. Itâs one thing to have a <span id="C205" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">polarized political discourse with heated disagreements</span>; itâs another to have <span id="C206" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">millions of Americans who think, with complete sincerity, that the leaders of the <span id="C207" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Political Idea">opposition party</span> are kidnapping and cannibalizing innocent children</span>.</p>

								<p>Combine those <span id="C208" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Anger">violent, paranoid fantasies</span> with the fact that <span id="C209" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">QAnon followers</span> have been <span id="C210" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">charged with committing serious crimes in <span id="P77" class="mention person" about="Q" data-label="Q">Q</span>âs name</span>, and itâs no wonder people are worried.</p>

								<span class="dropCap red">S</span>ome time next year, the <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="ECHR" data-label="ECHR">European court of human rights</span></span> will decide on the case of a <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Dutch woman who feels unfairly treated</span> because her countryâs <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Statement">highest court has told her <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Statement">she cannot wear a plastic colander on her head for her ID photo</span></span>.</p>

								<p>It may combine <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="MinkeDeWilde" data-label="Minke De Wilde">Mienke de Wilde</span>âs <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Statement">plea</span> with that of an <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Austrian former MP</span>, <span id="P3" class="mention person" about="NikoAlm" data-label="Niko Alm">Niko Alm</span>, who <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">proudly wears the offending kitchen utensil on his official documents</span> but now <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">insists his country recognise <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> â the faith both follow â as a <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">religion</span></span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">Watching the pair closely</span> is <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Mike Arthur</span>, an independent American film-maker whose smart, funny but above all thought-provoking <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Observation">documentary</span>, I, Pastafari, about the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">worldâs fastest-growing faith</span> premieres in the <span id="L2" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> in October.</p>

								<p>All in all, it is shaping up to be quite a big few months for the <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</span>, whose <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believers</span> <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">wear strainers on their heads in homage to their deity, strive to be nice to pretty much everyone, and conclude their prayers with ârâamenâ rather than âamenâ</span>.</p>

								<p>It sounds, of course, like a joke. On one level, it is. But for <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Arthur</span>, who has spent three years working on his <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">film</span>, and for many <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> who believe their <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">faith embodies some profound â and profoundly important â principles</span>, it is a lot more.</p>

								<p>âWe live,â says <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="MikeArthur" data-label="Mike Arthur">Arthur</span>, sitting in an <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="Amsterdam" data-label="Amsterdam" data-wikidata-id="Q727">Amsterdam</span> cafe, âin the age of unreason. We no longer value the best idea, but the loudest idea. From <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Event"><span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="Brexit">Brexit</span></span> to <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump">Trump</span>, we applaud <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Faith">blind faith</span> and are sceptical about <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">overwhelming observable evidence</span>.</p>

								<p>âThe problem is that <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">rationality</span> is just no match for <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Faith">irrationality</span>. That ship sailed in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span>. People now donât change their minds, they double down on their irrationality, and using <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">facts, science and reason</span> to <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">contest the unreasonable</span> is simply driving us all further apart. Maybe itâs time to try a different approach.â</p>

								<p>A different approach is, undeniably, what <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> offers. The church was founded in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2005" data-label="2005">2005</span> by <span id="P9" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Bobby Henderson</span>, at the time a 25-year-old <span id="L3" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">physics</span> graduate, as a response to <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">Christian fundamentalists</span> demanding the <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Teaching">teaching</span> of <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism</span> in <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="Kansas" data-label="Kansas" data-wikidata-id="Q1558">Kansas</span> school <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Education">science classes</span>. Its name is a portmanteau of pasta and <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Rastafarianism">Rastafarianism</span>.</p>

								<p>In an open letter, <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Henderson</span> argued that if <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">intelligent design</span> was to be taught alongside <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Evolution">evolution</span>, so should the belief that, <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Pastafarianism">with the aid of His Noodly Appendages, an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe, probably after drinking heavily (thus explaining its many flaws)</span>.</p>

								<p>Like other <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">religions</span>, the <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">church</span> has a <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">gospel</span> and, rather than commandments, eight <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">âIâd really rather you didnâtsâ</span> (two having been lost). These suggest ways to <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">live your life happily without infringing on othersâ rights to do the same</span> â a morality based on <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">harmonious co-existence, nonjudgmental conduct âand generally not being a dick</span>â.</p>

								<p><span id="P11" class="mention person" about="BobbyHenderson" data-label="Bobby Henderson">Henderson</span>âs basic point, expertly if satirically made, was that <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">since <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">intelligent design</span> was every bit as much of an <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">evidence-based theory</span> as the <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">unshakable belief that the world was created by an omniscient flying monster made of spaghetti</span>, nothing should be <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Teaching">taught in science classes</span> but <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">science</span></span>.</p>

								<p>But as it has grown â there are now <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> from <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="Poland" data-label="Poland" data-wikidata-id="Q36">Poland</span> to <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="NewZealand" data-label="New Zealand" data-wikidata-id="Q664">New Zealand</span> and <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Italy" data-label="Italy" data-wikidata-id="Q38">Italy</span> to <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Taiwan" data-label="Taiwan" data-wikidata-id="Q865">Taiwan</span>, and <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">the church</span> is <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">officially recognised</span> in at least four countries â it has begun posing bigger questions: <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what actually is a religion? Who gets to decide that? And why should faith â or lack of it â have anything to do with rights?</span></p>

								<p>For <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Derk Venema</span>, an eloquent Dutch legal expert who has worked with <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="MinkeDeWilde" data-label="Minke De Wilde">De Wilde</span>, his former student, to <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">develop her arguments for <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">wearing a colander</span> on her driving licence photo</span>, <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> raises <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">genuine human rights issues</span> â even if (or perhaps because)<span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Satire"> it is also satirical</span>.</p>

								<p>âI started out thinking this was just a big joke,â <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span> says. âBut the more you look at it, the more you see it is about <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">fundamental principles</span>. The <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="DutchCourts" data-label="Dutch Courts">Dutch courts</span></span> have <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">denied it has any serious message</span>, but it manifestly does: <span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">non-violence, tolerance, loving each other</span> â the same principles as <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">many established religions</span>.â</p>

								<p>The <span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="ECHR" data-label="ECHR">European court</span> has previously determined that <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">to be recognised as such, a <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">religion</span> must be cogent, coherent, important to its followers, and âseriousâ</span>. On the latter point, <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span> argues that <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Poiliteness">the humour and good fun</span> of <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> is simply a more <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Satire">modern, accessible way of getting its message across</span>.</p>

								<p>âI can imagine it all looks very odd if youâre <span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">not a believer</span>. But thatâs the case with <span id="C75" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">many faiths â people who walk on water or split themselves in three</span>, for example. Personally, I find other religions unbelievable.â</p>

								<p>Moreover, argues <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span>, even <span id="C77" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">theologians have ânever really been able to agree on what constitutes a religion. So should the state really get to decide</span>? For me, if it looks like a religion, with certain <span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">customs and traditions</span>; if <span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">its followers</span> <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">call it a religion</span>; and if <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social Act">they call themselves believers</span>, that should be it.â</p>

								<p>Most importantly, in many societies <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">belief</span> in an <span id="C83" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Religion">established religion</span> comes with certain privileges: from the <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">right to sport religious headwear on your ID photo</span> in the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="Netherlands" data-label="Netherlands" data-wikidata-id="Q55">Netherlands</span>, to <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">faith schools</span> in the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="UK" data-label="UK" data-wikidata-id="Q145">UK</span> and <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">full-scale tax exemption</span> for <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q145">US</span> megachurches. âWe say, as long as there are <span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">special rights</span> for <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believers</span>, they should apply to all religions,â says <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="DerkVenema" data-label="Derk Venema">Venema</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="P20" class="mention person" about="NikoAlm" data-label="Niko Alm">Alm</span>, a journalist, writer, publisher and former MP, <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">has fought his five-year court battle to get <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Pastafarianism</span> recognised as a religion</span> in <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Austria" data-label="Austria" data-wikidata-id="Q40">Austria</span> as part of a broader struggle for a <span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">true separation of church and state</span> and <span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">genuine religious freedom</span> â which, he argues, should include  <span id="C93" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">freedom from religion</span>.</p>

								<p>âAll we <span id="C94" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Act">ask is a level playing field</span>,â he says. "<span id="C95" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">Total neutrality of the state towards whatever belief I hold</span>. We donât want anything forbidden, but <span id="C96" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">the law must apply equally to all of us</span>, <span id="C97" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">whatever we believe in</span> and whether <span id="C98" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">we believe nothing at all</span>. <span id="C99" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Legal Right">Complete freedom of religion</span>. Itâs political.â</p>

								<p>He readily concedes, however, that <span id="C100" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pastafarianism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</span> is a diverse church. âFor some, itâs not a political thing at all. In some countries, <span id="C101" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Pastafarians</span> mainly just want <span id="C102" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Principle">to have fun and eat pasta</span>.â</p>

								<p><span id="P3" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: So I'm <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">Michael Marshall</span> and I'm the project director of the <span class="credit"><span id="O3" class="mention organization" about="Good Thinking Society" data-label="Good Thinking Society">Good Thinking Society</span></span>, which is a charity based in the <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="United Kingdom" data-label="UnitedKingdom" data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span>. Uh, the whole purpose of our charity is to promote <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">science</span> to challenge <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</span>. So we'll do work, uh, to forward <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Science education">science education</span>. And then another part of the, the work that we do, which is the bulk of my work, is to find <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span> that aren't backed by <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span>  and find people who are promoting those <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span>, find people who are buying into those <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas</span> and to explore them and figure out if anything can be done to prevent people being confused by them, harmed by them misled by them in those kinds of things. So I spent a lot of my time looking at things like alternative cancer kills and the people who promote those and <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">alternative medicine</span>. I've spent a lot of my time going to see people who say they can  <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">talk to dead</span>. Who say they can do  <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">faith healing</span>.</p>

								<p>And then another part of my, uh, my time is spent talking to people who believe in, uh, unusual ideas and who are kind of proponents of them. And that's how I came across the <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> world, uh, is through my, uh, slightly odd, uh, hobby. Uh, at the time before I was working full time as a, as a <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">skeptic</span>, it was a hobby of mine to, um, be in rooms filled with <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">people who disagree</span> with me. To just understand what brings people to <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">ideas that I would look at and say, well, this can't be true</span>. These kinds of <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Belief">fringe and extreme and unusual beliefs</span>. Um, what brings people to believe them and what kind of paths lead people there? What <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span> supports, uh, supports their <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">position in their minds</span> and how do they engage with the world with that worldview and try and have conversations.</p>

								<p>I've got a podcast where I talk to people who have kind of <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">fringe beliefs</span> and instead of having a <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversation</span> that a lot of people would have, if they are a <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">skeptic</span> about something and they're talking to a <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">believer</span> where you <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anger">shout at them</span> and <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Anger">tell them they're wrong</span> and <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">point out all the <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">evidence</span></span> and <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">tell them</span>, and it gets into quite a volatile <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">discussion</span> sometimes instead of that, I try and have a <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">civil and polite chat</span> to try and explore the gap between us. So I say, I don't believe in this <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">idea of yours</span>, but I'm really interested to figure out why <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">I don't believe it</span> and why <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">you do</span> so <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">let's have a conversation</span>. So I have these kinds of <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Politeness">civil discussions</span> and that's kind of how I came across a that the<span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth"> flat earth theory</span> and the idea that there are <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people walking around today who <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">think the world is flat</span></span>.</p>

								<p><span id="P5" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: It's really interesting and serendipitous that we're sitting here because I knew that there was some <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> out there and I just thought it was kind of strange and funny. And about a week ago, I discovered a friend of mine who is very well educated, she's got a doctorate in biochemistry and, uh, she has a sister who's also very intelligent and very well educated. And my friend told me that her sister is a <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and that her sister is very indignant about the, uh, idea that, um, <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">we</span> don't take them seriously. And she said something to the effect of, this is hearsay that we're getting from me right now. That, well, you know, if you looked at the <span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">evidence</span>, then you'd know that <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">what you've been told</span> isn't true. So all of a sudden I became fascinated with the <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth people</span> and then just on <span class="credit"><span id="O4" class="mention organization" about="Twitter" data-label="Twitter">Twitter</span></span> and I hadn't, I had not been a follower of yours until I saw this tweet that somebody I follow must've retweeted a, that you had just given a talk in <span id="L5" class="mention place" about="Edinburgh" data-label="Edinburgh" data-wikidata-id="Q23436">Edinburgh</span> where I had been. And, uh, so I reached out to you and it turns out you live in <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="Liverpool" data-label="Liverpool" data-wikidata-id="Q24826">Liverpool</span> and here I am in <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Liverpool" data-label="Liverpool" data-wikidata-id="Q24826">Liverpool</span> today. So, uh, that's why we're here talking. So tell me what do the <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth people</span>, uh, think and why do they think it?</p>

								<p><span id="P6" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: So you've got to sort of unpack that question a little bit because it's very easy for us to see, uh, the <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> as one singular cohesive movement. And that's how I first thought about it when I first came across it in <span id="D1" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> and when I came across the <span class="credit"><span id="O5" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> in the <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="United Kingdom" data-label="UnitedKingdom" data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span>. And so I had a <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversation</span> with the vice president of the <span class="credit"><span id="O6" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span>. And I assumed, as you probably have in your mind, that <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe the world is flat</span> think that <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">the world is a disc</span>. And in the center you've got the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span>, then you've got all the continents of the <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="World" data-wikidata-id="Q2">World</span> sort of splayed out to fill the circle. And an <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is like the ed<span class="credit"><span id="O7" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> is that not everyone in the flat earth world has that version of the <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Earth" data-label="Earth" data-wikidata-id="Q2">World</span> in their heads.</p>

								<p>Some do believe <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">it's a disk</span>, but others believe that, yes,<span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">there's <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span> in the middle and there's the land masses around it. And then on <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is the ice around the edge, but instead of it being a discreet disc, some people believe, in fact <span id="L15" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> just goes on forever in all directions</span>. And so they believe that the earth is actually an infinite plane in all directions. That bisect reality, which is a really lovely idea.</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P7" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: What does that mean?</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P8" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">So it will go on in North, South, East, West, just go on forever and there is the above and the below, but there's no way of getting from the top to the bottom because it's just infinity of all ice in all directions forever. So there's no way of getting below the earth.</span> And so this was a, when I first came across the <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> in <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> this was quite a <span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">vociferous debate</span> that was going on.</p>

								<p>And it was quite a schism really. And so they had the, the <span class="credit"><span id="O8" class="mention organization" about="Flat Earth Society" data-label="Flat Heart Society">Flat Earth Society</span></span> at the time, it was largely a forum where they would bring forth <span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">their proofs</span> of <span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">one version of this theory or another</span>. And I also think there's another schism going on in the movement at the time, which is between one side, which are <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who genuinely really believed <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world was flat</span></span>. And <span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">the other side, which absolutely did not believe it, but enjoy the intellectual pursuit of arguing a position they need to be false</span>. And so they would find <span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">quite esoteric and off the wall proofs that most people wouldn't think of</span>. And so when I first came across it in <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> there were people waiting into these arguments who <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">believed the world was round but had never thought about it before, but just assumed in a sort quite an arrogant way that they must know better than anybody who's ever thought about it and come to a different conclusion</span>.</p>

								<p>And so they were stomping into these <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">arguments</span> saying, well, <span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">what about photos of the earth from space and what about this</span>? And what about <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">ships going over the horizon thinking, well this is the gotcha</span>, but not realizing that those were the first things they'd thought about, that they thought that <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">the world, the approved world's round</span>. And therefore it's probably likely that the <span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who think <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span></span>, I've had the same idea and yet they're still people who think <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span><span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span>, so at least in their mind they must have a good answer to that. That the <span id="C69" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">people who believe <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Round Earth">the world was round</span></span> having these arguments didn't have cause they'd never scrutinized the idea. They rejecting it. And so what was happening was I think to a degree, the part of the schism that were just having fun and knew very well the <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Round Earth">world wasn't flat</span>, but just enjoyed the pursuit of doing that.</p>

								<p>They were winning those <span id="C72" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">arguments with people who were coming in and arrogantly assuming that they could answer everything</span>. And in winning those arguments, they were really <span id="C73" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">converting even more people who really believed it</span>. And so you had this kind of effect where it was sort of spiral out of control a little bit, but I think it wasn't, it wasn't viral in the way that in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="2013" data-label="2013">2013</span> as a in the way that it was in <span id="D5" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> and <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="2017" data-label="2017">2017</span> and I think part of that is because that <span id="C74" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Proofs">esoteric off the wall version of proofs can be quite complicated to get your head around</span>. So for example, if you have the <span id="C75" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">disk version</span>, the world and <span id="C76" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">the infinite plane version</span>, both models suffer from an inability to explain <span id="C77" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span>. You don't have a <span id="C78" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">spherical mass, you don't have a central mass, you don't have a central point pulling it all to one point</span>.</p>

								<p>So it's very difficult to explain <span id="C79" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span> in either one of those models. But these people who were doing kind of <span id="C80" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">esoteric arguments</span> were saying, well, <span id="C81" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">what is gravity? Gravity is an accelerant, falls towards the ground, I think 9.8 meters per second squared, accelerates downward</span>. They said that is identical to a world in which <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the ground accelerates upwards to meet you. And so when you let go of something, it isn't that it's accelerating downwards, it's a, the ground's actually accelerating up to meet it</span>.</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P9" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: So it's a form of relativity.</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P10" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: This is exactly where they come to. So people would then <span id="C82" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">say, well, <span id="C84" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">if it's, if <span id="C85" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Palne Earth">the ground is the earth is, you know, an infinite plane in all directions that bisects reality and is accelerating upward at 9.8 meters per second squared and always has been since the Dawn of time</span>, you'd hit a problem, which would be the <span id="C86" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">speed of light</span>.</span></span> </p>

								<p><span id="C87" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">You can't go fast. The speed of light</span>. So people don't have a gotcha for this. And so the <span id="C88" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who were putting forth esoteric off the wall trollish arguments</span> would <span id="C89" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">say, well, look at <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="AlbertEinstein" data-label="Albert Einstein">Einstein</span>'s <span id="C90" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Scientifical Theory">theory of relativity</span> <span span id="C91" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">as you approach Lightspeed, time itself slows down</span> and the maths in their head works back out again. So yes,<span id="C92" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">we're getting quicker, but time's getting slower and we can account for <span id="C93" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravity</span> in that way</span></span>. And that's quite a complicated idea to get your head around. And so I think the fact that <span id="C94" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Explanation">these people were winning arguments was getting, was converting some people to movement, but the way in which they were winning them were keeping people away from the movement because they were quite complex ideas</span>. You couldn't<span id="C95" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social"> stick them on a meme</span> as you can these days. Here's a picture of the earth. You couldn't explain all that stuff about science, the relativity proven gravity and an infinite plane version of the world.</p>

								<p>So I think there was a limiting factor going on and that's why when I first came across the <span id="C96" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span>, it was probably still pretty small, pretty unknown. I've been given talks about <span id="C97" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</span> for the last kind of five, six plus years. And I've mentioned that I came across the <span id="C98" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> and people would always say to me, there's nobody who actually believes that nobody actually, they don't really exist, that people are having fun. So it stayed quite small. And then in <span id="D7" class="mention date" about="2015" data-label="2015">2015</span> and <span id="D8" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> a couple of things happened that really ignited a movement. And it was the <span id="C99" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">publishing of two videos on <span class="credit"><span id="O9" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> or two video series on <span class="credit"><span id="O10" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span></span>. Um, one I believe was, uh, <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span>, 200 proofs. The earth is not spending globe. Uh, and the other was <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>'s, uh, uh, 14 videos in his <span id="C100" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> clues series.</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P14" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: So now, we're going to actually be <span id="C101" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">converting</span>
								 more people.</p>

								<p><span id="P15" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: Well, it's, they are genuinely worth looking up because what I found really fascinating about the <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span> 200 proofs, the are 200 of them in there, is that, uh, it was published in <span id="D9" class="mention date" about="2016" data-label="2016">2016</span> so it was three years after we had the, uh, <span id="C102" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">infinite plane</span> and the <span id="C103" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Gravity">gravitational kind of explanation via <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="AlbertEinstein" data-label="Albert Einstein">Einstein</span>'s theory</span> relative to, so it was three years of what you'd expect to be evolution and sophistication and, but in fact, proof number one, <span id="C104" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">the horizon looks flat proof</span>. Number two, <span id="C105" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">even if you go up a mountain, the horizon looks flat</span>. Proof number three, <span id="C106" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">water, uh, cant stick to a curved surface. It always goes level and you can't get it. So there's no way it could stick to a ball</span>. So they're all very, very simplistic arguments. And there's 200 of them. Um, some of them stick to sort of a <span id="C107" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">pseudo physical properties</span>. Others go to a <span id="C108" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>.</p>

								<p>So I think proof 199 is saying that, well <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="IsaacNewton" data-label="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</span> and <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="NeilArmstrong" data-label="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</span> and <span id="P20" class="mention person" about="GalileoGalilei" data-label="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</span>, they were all <span id="C110" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">Freemasons</span>. Therefore <span id="C110" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>. And so you have this kind of a, this video and it was also published as a free ebook which collected lots of different so-called proofs of the world being flat that picked from lots of different genre of proof. So if you came to the <span id="C111" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span>, if you, if you were generally interested in <span id="C112" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>, you'd come to it and you'd find enough <span id="C113" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">conspiracy theory reasons</span> to believe <span id="C114" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span> in there. If you came to it because you, uh, placed way too much emphasis on the, uh, the, the, <span id="C115" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">your own powers of observation. You know, you can't show me the curve. I'm looking out at horizon. I can't see the curve. You can't tell me my eyes are wrong</span>. If that's your, your style of thinking.</p>

								<p>There were arguments in there for you that would tell you that that would support the idea of <span id="C116" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>. So I think it kind of covered all its bases a little bit. If you came from a <span id="C117" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">fundamentalist Christian perspective</span>, uh, in a <span id="C118" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">biblical literalism</span><span id="C119" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the world is 6,000 years old and created in seven days as per the Bible</span>, uh, which a large part of, of <span id="C120" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earth movement</span> is actually crash <span id="C121" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism</span> in a, in another guys. Um, there were <span id="C122" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">creationist arguments in there that would support, uh, the, the, the idea of the world is flat</span>. So it really did pull together different genre of flat earth arguments into one document. And I think that's why it became quite successful because it had a little bit in for anybody who might be, uh, in any way inclined to doubt the veracity of the round earth theory.</p>

								<p></p>

								<p><span id="P21" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: That inclination is usually a preexisting condition.</p>

								<p><span id="P22" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: I think so. I think so. So a lot of the way that people are stumped, we're coming across this information was through <span class="credit"><span id="O11" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> recommendations. Uh, this is, I think it was a study by the <span class="credit"><span id="O12" class="mention organization" about="AmericanAcademy" data-label="American Academy Of Sciences">American Academy of sciences</span></span> at their last kind of convention, which actually went there. The a scientist went along to the a <span id="L16" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">U.S.</span> flat earth convention and <span id="C123" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">spoke to people there and asked, how did you get into the flat earth movement?</span> And of the 40 people they asked, 39 of them said, I saw it recommended to me on <span class="credit"><span id="O13" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>. And the faulty of said, my son saw it, recommended to him on <span class="credit"><span id="O14" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> and pass it along to me. So it's what's appearing in that right-hand bar of up next on <span class="credit"><span id="O15" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>. So I think when there were people who were looking for moon landing denial videos, <span class="credit"><span id="O16" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span>, once these <span id="C124" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">Flat earth videos started getting out there and started having a sensationalist kind of style, so it'd have a sensationalist title</span>, uh, there'd be people, people would come and watch it because they believed it.</p>

								<p>Some people watch it cause they thought it was silly. Some people watched it because they wanted to <span id="C125" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">scrutinize it on a point by point basis and watch it five times in a row to really get to the grips of every single argument</span>. So they could write an article about how wrong it is. <span class="credit"><span id="O17" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> at the time said that it didn't say there's three distinct audiences with three distinct agendas. It says there's one audience of three times the size. So this is a pretty good video because loads of people are watching this all the way to the end. And so once <span class="credit"><span id="O17" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> saw that it started recommending it to people. So you'd be watching a video about moon landing denial and <span class="credit"><span id="O18" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> would say, I think someone who's a bit into <span id="C126" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">moon landing denial</span> might also be into the <span id="C127" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth theory</span> and it would float it there as a suggestion.</p>

								<p><span id="C128" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">And if people clicked it, that solidified that link a little bit and the more people clicked it, the more that became solidified.</span> And I think that's how a lot of people find their way in. And then it's because it became such a solid link. I think it even went beyond people who are already looking for <span id="C129" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span>, uh, ideas. Um, you had people who'd be looking for <span id="C130" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">videos of the, of the earth from space and they might see this video and then then they might watch it</span>. And then that kind of strengthens those relationships. So <span class="credit"><span id="O19" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> had this kind of arguably accidental, I don't think they were deliberately doing it, but had this <span id="C131" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">algorithm</span> that was recommending <span id="C132" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">sensationalist and extreme ideas</span> regularly to people who were searching for things that weren't necessarily about that. And I think that did serve as a, as a <span id="C133" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">recruitment tool</span> and <span id="C134" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">those two videos and the responses to those, those two videos and video series from <span id="P23" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>, <span id="P24" class="mention person" about="EricDubay" data-label="Eric Dubay">Eric Dubay</span>, that really ignited a movement</span> because I think they came around with just the right time or the wrong time in our perspective, uh, that it captured, uh, that <span class="credit"><span id="O20" class="mention organization" about="YouTube" data-label="YouTube">YouTube</span></span> <span id="C135" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">algorithm</span> in full flow.</p>

								<p><span id="P25" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: Uh, so what do just, I'm interested specifically in the videos you say of, uh, the earth from space or the moon. What's the response? Those are all faked?</p>

								<p><span id="P26" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: Yeah, pretty much. So, uh, I, I've, I've had lots of <span id="C136" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">conversations</span> with <span id="C137" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> and when you bring up those visual pieces of evidence, they'll say, well come on, <span id="C138" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">you can't trust visual evidence</span>. And they say photographs for example, <span id="C139" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">you show me a photograph from of the, of the earth from space</span>. <span id="C140" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Alleged Proof">I'll show you a composite job, I'll show you a Photoshop job, I'll show you a hoax</span>. And they'll say that <span id="C141" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof"><span class="credit"><span id="O21" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span></span> even admits that those four photographs are composites, is that, will they are composites</span>. But <span id="C142" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">even if they are, composites, they're composites of what their comes into photos taken from space. It's just they're taken with a camera that isn't far enough away to get the entire earth and in one goal. But you're going to see snapshots of the earth and then you come, you compose those together because you've got a two dimensional representation of a three dimensional object</span>.</p>

								<p>You're going to have to sort of stitch those together a little bit, but <span id="C143" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">just cause it's a composite, it's gotta be it composed of something you're saying. It's a composite doesn't throw out the fact that this is actually a genuine photo as well</span>. Um, and so they will talk a lot about how, uh, <span id="C144" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">we can't trust <span class="credit"><span id="O22" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span></span>. That's a big, big part of it. <span class="credit"><span id="O23" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is part of the conspiracy, some lots of the <span id="C145" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> that I've met, I went along to the <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="U.K." data-label="U.K." data-wikidata-id="Q145">U.K.</span> <span id="C146" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span> and spent three days in a hotel in <span id="L18" class="mention place" about="Birmingham" data-label="Birmingham" data-wikidata-id="Q2256">Birmingham</span> with 160 <span id="C147" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span>, one of the most genuinely enjoyable weekends of my entire life. Really, really fun. Um, and <span id="C148" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">I went there not to tell them they're wrong and not to be superior, but to really understand what brings people to that movement</span>. Um, but what I heard lots of time was that well, <span class="credit"><span id="O24" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is evil.</p>

								<p><span class="credit"><span id="O25" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is a tool of the <span class="credit"><span id="O26" class="mention organization" about="Governement" data-label="Governement">government</span></span>, a tool of the <span class="credit"><span id="O27" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span>, a tool of the new world order. Um, they rely on their budgets so they need to keep that money rolling in, which is why they keep churning out material that suggest the world is round. Um, some people even believe that <span class="credit"><span id="O28" class="mention organization" about="NASA" data-label="NASA">NASA</span></span> is a tool of <span id="P27" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span>. Uh, and they have all sorts of convoluted uh, explanations as to why that is. Uh, one of my favorite explanations was one of the speakers at the <span id="C149" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span> an <span id="C150" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">Argentinian conspiracy theorist</span> who said, <span id="C151" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">we know for a fact that the <span class="credit"><span id="O29" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a front for the one world order because if you look at the Spanish name for the <span class="credit"><span id="O30" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> , it is the <span class="credit"><span id="O31" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">O N U</span></span>  and if you read that backwards it's U N O which is Spanish for one. And therefore we know for a fact the <span class="credit"><span id="O32" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a, a front for the one world order because the reverse name of it in Spanish is Spanish for one</span>.</p>

								<p>And my friend I was at the convention with leftover and said does he realize that<span class="credit"> <span id="O33" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is already French for one?</p>

								<p><span id="P28" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: That logic that <span id="C152" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">numerology</span>, when you connect the dots like that is so it's so intriguing.</p>

								<p><span id="P29" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: It is. And so they'll see that and they'll say, well, look at the, uh, look at the image, the logo of the <span class="credit"><span id="O34" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> and you have the flat earth, you have the <span id="L19" class="mention place" about="ArcticCircle" data-label="Arctic circle" data-wikidata-id="Q176609">Arctic circle</span> in the middle, you have all the continents around it. And so let's say, <span id="C153" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why would the <span class="credit"><span id="O35" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> have the flat earth as their logo? If it isn't true that the world is flat?</span> And I had this conversation with the <span id="C154" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and I said, well, what else would you want the <span class="credit"><span id="O36" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span>'s logo to be? And it's, well you could, <span id="C155" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">if the earth is really round, you'd show it from the side</span>.</p>

								<p>Okay, but then <span id="C156" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">which countries are you not putting on? Do you want to show <span id="L20" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> and not <span id="L21" class="mention place" about="Europe" data-label="Europe" data-wikidata-id="Q46">Europe</span>? Do you want to show the <span id="L22" class="mention place" about="NorthernHemisphere" data-label="Northern Hemisphere" data-wikidata-id="Q39061">Northern hemisphere</span> and not show <span id="L23" class="mention place" about="Australia" data-label="Australia" data-wikidata-id="Q408">Australia</span>? Right?</span> And so he said, well, okay, fine. <span id="C157" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">So you show up from the top. But if that's the case, why isn't that <span id="L24" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> on the <span class="credit"><span id="O37" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span>'s logo, it's missing</span>. And his idea for that is<span id="C158" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"> because <span id="L25" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> is either the disk around the edge or it's where the dome that surrounds the world is</span>. And <span id="C159" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Expalin">I said, well, <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="Antarctica" data-label="Antarctica" data-wikidata-id="Q51">Antarctica</span> isn't a nation. This is the <span class="credit"><span id="O38" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">United Nations</span></span>. It isn't a nation. You know, there's good reasons</span>. If you, if you sort of sense check these ideas, but if you're presented them in a way that says the <span class="credit"><span id="O39" class="mention organization" about="UN" data-label="UN">UN</span></span> is a front for the <span class="credit"><span id="O40" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span> and the one world order, and here's proof, <span id="C160" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">look at their logo, therefore flat and you're not, then encouraged to sense check your ideas to uh, to look for ways to doubt yourself, to look for ways to disprove your theories rather than looking for evidence that proves them</span>.</p>

								<p>You end up in a place where all you're doing is confirming your ideas further and further and further. And this is what we see. We see it in our lives all the time and we're guilty of it all the time. But I think we're guilty of this. This is a movement that's specifically guilty of it.</p>

								<p><span id="P30" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: Does Heliocentrism hold and the other planets are flat disks or something as well or are they?</p>

								<p><span id="P31" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: yeah, it depends on who you talk. So it's not just that there's the <span id="C161" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">disk version</span> and the <span id="C162" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Infinite Plane Earth">infinite plane version</span>. There's actually lots of, there's a myriad of different versions of the, the flat earth and the universe beyond it. So some will believe that we're flat. But the universe around it is pretty much as is, that's quite a niche belief in the flat earth world. Um, some believe that, uh, many believe the sun isn't very far away, so it's very hard to, to uh, justify the solar system as conventional science would have it with a flat earth belief, especially a flat earth belief that may be rooted in <span id="C163" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Foundamental Christianism">creationism and therefore has this kind of earth as the center of everything</span> kind of way.</p>

								<p>And you know, <span id="C164" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the sun was created on, on one of the days after the earth, it was already created</span>. And so some of that belief that <span id="C165" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">instead of the sun being millions and millions of miles away, it's actually quite nearby and much smaller</span>. And that's how they account for time differences across, uh, across the world. How you account for seasons, it's just that you're further away from the sun at that point. Um, others believe that <span id="C166" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Disk Earth">the world is a disk, but it's under a dome</span>. Um, which again goes back to the <span id="C167" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">biblical idea of the firmament from and being the roof on top of the world</span>. Um, one of the, one of the, the, uh, piece of evidence I've heard brought, uh, for that, uh, firmament idea for that domed theory. A idea was from <span id="P32" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> who said, uh, if you look at the gravestone of <span id="P33" class="mention person" about="WernerVonBraun" data-label="Werner Von Braun">Werner Von Braun</span>, so <span id="P34" class="mention person" about="WernerVonBraun" data-label="Werner Von Braun">Von Braun</span>, obviously the, uh, the, the Nazi scientist smuggled out of <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span> after the second world war by operation paperclip installed towards the head of the <span id="L28" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">U.S.</span> space program. Um, his V2 rocket technology is partly responsible for, for <span id="L29" class="mention place" about="US" data-label="US" data-wikidata-id="Q30">America</span> getting into it, getting to the moon first. Um, but if you look on his gravestone, it references <span id="C168" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">Psalms 19</span> one. And if you look up Psalms 19 one, it reads, <span id="C169" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Bible">the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork</span>. So it says <span id="P35" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span>, <span id="C170" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Alleged Proof">why would the father of space exploration have on his gravestone a reference to the biblical roof on top of the world, if not a post deathbed confessional? Here's what of saying, there is a firmament and the only way to get me out of <span id="L30" class="mention place" about="Germany" data-label="Germany" data-wikidata-id="Q183">Germany</span>  was to go along with their hoax</span>.</p>

								<p>Now I would argue the reference is much more about the first bit of the heavens declare the glory of God for a man who saw his technology has been the key to the heavens. It was the, the way that men put mankind, unlocked the sky. Um, but if you're a <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> or you see that gravestone, and this is proof then that there is a roof on top of the world and if you believe there's a roof on top of the world, then it starts to ask questions about what is space beyond it. And so I spoke to <span id="P36" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> about this and he said, well, <span id="C171" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the sun or moon is still there, but they're much closer and they're separate bodies with their own separate light sources</span>. And the way we know that, he said, it's because <span id="C172" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">sunlight is warm and Moonlight is cold</span>. And I said, <span id="C173" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what do you mean by that</span>?</p>

								<p>He said, well, <span id="C174" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Alleged Proof">sunlight, obviously warms you. He said, yeah, that wasn't a bit undisputed. Uh, he said, Moonlight. He said, if you go out in the night with a thermometer and you put that in shadow and take a temperature reading, and then you move it away from the shadow into the open clearing and then take a temperature reading, the temperature drops. And that's because the Moonlight is cooling the thermometer down.</span> Well, what's actually happening is <span id="C175" class="mention concept" about="facts" data-label="Evidence">your first temperature reading is in shadow and therefore in a shaded area. And then to get into Moonlight, you have to move it out of a shaded area and expose it to whatever, whatever other winds and things you have. And that's a, that's the reason for it"</span>. Um, and so when, my favorite things about <span id="P37" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark Sargent</span> 's theory actually is that like many flat earthers, he was a <span id="C176" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">conspiracy theorist</span> who believed in all sorts of <span id="C177" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracies beforehand</span>.</p>

								<p>So, uh, <span id="C178" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief"><span id="P38" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">JFK</span> was assassinated by the government or by an insight. It was an inside job</span>. <span id="C179" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">The moon landing was never real</span>. Uh, he believed there was a <span id="C180" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">civilization used to live on Mars who carved a face on a rock on Mars</span>. All the, all the kind of classic stuff. And so when I spoke to <span id="P39" class="mention person" about="MarkSargent" data-label="Mark Sargent">Mark</span>, I thought one of the ways to try and understand, um, <span id="C181" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">what counts as a standard of evidence and how do you sense check? I thought I'd ask him, was there ever a <span id="C182" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theory</span> that you used to believe in that you now no longer believed to be true?</span> And I thought maybe this will help me understand where you can come back from an idea. He said, well, it's funny because I used to, he said, I used to always wonder <span id="C183" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why are all these different conspiracies true</span>? And then I realized <span id="C184" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">the world is flat</span>.</p>

								<p>It all made sense because I thought, <span id="C185" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">why did the government killed <span id="P40" class="mention person" about="JohnFitzgeraldKennedy" data-label="John Fitzgerald Kennedy">JFK</span>? It's because they knew that we couldn't get to the moon</span>. So <span id="C186" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">the moon landing had to be faked because you can't get past the firmament because the world is flat and under a dome</span>. So he said it was like, um, the, uh, the, the <span id="C187" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">flat earth is kind of the Rosetta stone of <span id="C188" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> to a degree</span>. It makes all the rest of it make sense. But he said there's one thing that no longer makes sense to me because <span id="C189" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">I no longer believe that there's a face on Mars. And I want to meet the guy who came up with that cause I really want to know who's behind him</span>. And I said, yeah, <span id="C190" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">that's cause you no longer believe in Mars. That's cause you believe that the planets and the stars are just projections on the dome. So you have a different view of the universe depending on what version of a, of the flat earth you, uh, you believe in</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="P41" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>:What are some of the,um, most popular, um, <span id="C191" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span>? You know, the, the <span id="C192" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> also believe in, are they <span id="C193" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">anti vacs</span> predominantly?</p>

								<p><span id="P42" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>:Yeah. So this is where I think it gets quite important for me because, uh, when I spent time at the, at the, the <span id="C194" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">flat earth convention</span>, when I've talked to <span id="C195" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earthers</span> and then talk to people who are, you know, <span id="C196" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Skeptic">scientists and skeptics about it</span>, they all say, well, at least the <span id="C197" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> is harmless. And I think the problem is, uh, the <span id="C198" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> beliefs don't exist in isolation. So one of things that really surprised me actually at the, at the <span id="C199" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">convention</span> that I went to was how little material was about the flat earth. So the Argentinian, uh, <span id="C200" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theorist</span> that was presenting that I mentioned before, he was talking not only was the a one world order and <span class="credit"><span id="O41" class="mention organization" about="Illuminati" data-label="Illuminati">Illuminati</span></span> that was, you know, run by <span id="P43" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span> and, and various of the tools of <span id="P44" class="mention person" about="Satan" data-label="Satan">Satan</span>. But he was also pointing out how <span id="C201" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">dinosaurs were faked and how it was a, the dinosaurs were invented by an artist who looked at, who looked at our giraffes and rhinos and crocodiles and sort of mixed the three together to create dinosaurs</span>. But he also said, if you want to know who's really got the, what's really going on behind the world, read the book, the protocols of the <span id="C202" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">elders of Zion</span> and that will tell you what's going on. And</p>

								<p><span id="P45" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: There you go. Now, now you're really at the end. One of the good roots.</p>

								<p><span id="P46" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: Totally. And what surprised me was I was shocked to hear this hugely influential <span id="C203" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">antisemitic hoax document</span>. Uh, the protocols, elders designer, a <span id="C204" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">fake that was created to stir antisemitism</span>. I was shocked to hear that brought up on stage at this convention where I was expecting to hear about the flat earth, but I think I was the only one who was shocked. No one else seemed to bat an eyelid. And so we do see these different <span id="C205" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Conspiracy Theory">conspiracy theories</span> clustering together. And uh, I spoke to a journalist actually at the, at the convention that weekend and they were having a lovely old time interviewing people saying, Oh, isn't this fun? Isn't it silly? Said, well, it is fun, but if you really want to know what's going on, just see that couple over there with the baby. <span id="C206" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">Ask them if the baby's vaccinated, ask them in that baby was ill tomorrow</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C207" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">Would they go and see a doctor or would they believe that big pharma is a tool of oppression and evil and moneymaking, all this kind of stuff</span>. You know, one of the speakers at the <span id="C208" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Social">convention</span>, as well as being a <span id="C209" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">flat earther</span> and as well as being a <span id="C210" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">nine 11 truther</span> also believes that <span id="C211" class="mention concept" about="ideas" data-label="Belief">you can cure all manner of diseases, including HIV and AIDS by drinking or injecting your own urine</span>. And this is, these are ideas, these are the ideas that are sort of bedfellows. And so I think a flat earth is in some ways, it's just the most visible of a, an ecosystem of conspiracy theory. Uh, and I think if you really want to try and, uh, help people challenge their own beliefs in the flat earth, you have to see it as such. You can't see it in isolation. You have to try and look at the, the wider pattern that it fits within.</p>

								<p><span id="P47" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: Uh, this is so fascinating. Um, and you're obviously a tremendous talker. So why don't you, why don't you promote your podcast.</p>

								<p><span id="P48" class="mention person" about="MichaelMarshall" data-label="Michael Marshall">MM</span>: I've got a couple of things that I do, but the one in which <span id="C212" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">I talk to people who, uh, who put forward ideas that I disagree with is called be reasonable with the idea being that I'm there to be reasonable to put forward a reasonable face to it. And so, um, I've talked to all manner of people from <span id="C213" class="mention concept" about="positions" data-label="Believer">people who believe the world is flat</span> to <span id="C214" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Hollow Earth">people who believe the world is hollow</span></span>. I wish that's a really interesting interview because that goes in places in, in, in the same way that you might not associate, uh, <span id="C215" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">antisemitic hoaxes</span> with the <span id="C216" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth belief</span>. The <span id="C217" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Hollow Earth">hollow earth belief</span> goes into some of the key risk positions too. And that's well worth the listen. Um, and <span id="C218" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversation">I've interviewed people who believe they can <span id="C219" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">talk to the dead</span> and, and many of the things like that. But I've also interviewed people who are promoting, uh, the <span id="C220" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Pseudoscience">drinking of bleach as a cure for cancer</span>, uh, and people who are putting forward <span id="C221" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">white supremacists beliefs</span>, uh, <span id="C222" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Racism">anti-feminist beliefs </span> and some pretty extreme positions</span>.</p>

								<p>And the, the, the idea of the show really is to kind of understand the way we as people structure our beliefs. Cause I think the structuring of belief is very, uh, is very similar. The details of the beliefs change. And I think that <span id="C223" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Flat Earth">flat earth</span> is a, is a great way of examining the, the, the nature of belief, um, untainted by the possibility that it might be true. And then once you, <span id="C224" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Inquiry">once you really examine that and understand that once you've understood that the factors that influence people's beliefs, you can sort of lift that entire framework up and then lay it over some of these other beliefs that are much harder to point to a single fact that disproves it</span>. So I think, yeah, understanding people who hold fringe or extreme positions is a useful thing. If we want to <span id="C225" class="mention concept" about="means" data-label="Conversion">try and limit their influence and bring people back to a more <span id="C226" class="mention concept" about="theories" data-label="Science Theory">reasonable position</span></span>.</p>

								<p><span id="P49" class="mention person" about="SteveMirsky" data-label="Steve Mirsky">SM</span>: And, of course, bleach is back in the news, as some people have been recommending it as an anti-coronavirus gargle. Do not, under any circumstances, do that.</p>

The <span id="L34" class="mention place" about="GizaPyramid" data-label="Great Giza Pyramid" data-wikidata-id="Q37200">Great Pyramid</span> is made of <span id="C70" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Material">millions of precisely hewn stones weighing at least two tons each</span>. Even with todayâs cranes and other construction equipment, building a pyramid as big as that of <span id="P6" class="mention person" about="PharaohKhufu" data-label="Pharaoh Khufu">Pharaoh Khufu</span> would be a formidable challenge.</p>

								<p>And then <span id="C71" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">thereâs the astronomical configuration of <span id="L35" class="mention place" about="GizaPyramids" data-label="Giza Pyramids" data-wikidata-id="Q13217298">the pyramids</span>, which is said to align with the stars in <span id="L36" class="mention place" about="OrionBelt" data-label="Orion BeltOrion" data-wikidata-id="Q8860">Orionâs belt</span>.

								<p>The reasons for carving the <span id="C108" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Statue">moai</span> are mysterious, though <span id="C109" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">they were likely sculpted for religious or ritual reasons</span>.

								<p>In a <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">garden of wild flowers overlooking lakes and pastures</span>, we perform a <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Tradition">Qigong peace ritual, mimicking movements of sea turtles swimming in the ocean and eagles soaring through the air</span>. <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="Heidi" data-label="Heidi">Heidi</span>âs gentle manner is even warmer than the low-slung amber sun.</p>

One visiting priest astutely suggested <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="Heidi" data-label="Heidi">Heidi</span>âs new-found vocation was no coincidence: <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="Trosetvola" data-label="Trosetvola" data-wikidata-id="Q31234084">Troset</span> translates as âbelief placeâ.</p>

								<p>Serendipity also guided entrepreneurs <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="FrodeSakshaug" data-label="Frode Sakshaug">Frode</span> and <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="KristineSakshaug" data-label="Kristine Sakshaug">Kristine Sakshaug</span> in the construction of their <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Building">Oyna landscape hotel</span> in <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Inderoy" data-label="Inderoy" data-wikidata-id="Q488970">Inderoy</span>, a 50-minute drive north.

								<p>Launching in the middle of a pandemic was challenging, but with lockdown rules eased for Norwegians a couple of weeks after the hotel opened, it has been almost fully booked ever since.</p>

								<p>Solidarity has glued this community together. <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="FrodeSakshaug" data-label="Frode Sakshaug">Frode</span>, who grew up and played on the land where his hotel now sits, employed <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">local businesses for construction</span> and eschewed lucrative deals to work with an investor he knows and trusts. He constantly talks about âweâ and âusâ. Itâs a reminder that money isnât the only motivation in life.</p>

								<p>As we talk, Iâm swept up in their tidal wave of innovative ideas: <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Leisure">jazz concerts on the rocks, moonlit dancers emerging from the surf, and a philosophy for a new way of existence</span>. <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">Our thinking cogs are oiled with shots of Granskauen gin, distilled by local barman <span id="P18" class="mention person" about="DustinZimmerman" data-label="Dustin Zimmerman">Dustin Zimmerman</span> and his partner <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="MarenGrotte" data-label="Maren Grotte">Maren Grotte</span>.

								<p>Like so many products made in the countryside, Granskauen is served in the city, too.

								<p>Although <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Visitors">UK travellers</span> have been missed, proceedings have not ground to a halt.

								<p class="distant"> As the small plane banked steeply, I looked down on the <span id="C4" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">bug-eyed figure of a man pointing enigmatically at the sky</span>. It could have been a cartoon character from a contemporary TV show but the <span id="C5" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">35m-high geoglyph, known as the Astronaut</span>, was created around <span id="C6" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Ancient">2,000 years ago and</span>, after more than 80 years of research, we can still only guess why.</p>

								<p>Around 400km south of <span id="L4" class="mention place" about="Lima" data-label="Lima" data-wikidata-id="Q2868">Lima</span>, the <span id="L6" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> are <span id="C7" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">huge, intricate drawings etched on to the barren landscape of <span id="L7" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">Peruâs coastal desert</span></span>. They have perplexed <span id="C8" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Scientifical Study">archaeologists, anthropologists, scientists and enthusiastic amateurs</span> since they were discovered in the <span id="D2" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1920">1920s</span>. Over the years theyâve been identified as everything from an <span id="C9" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">astrological calendar to sacred pathways</span>, <span id="C10" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Alien Theories">a map of water sources to alien landing strips</span>, but their exact purpose and meaning still remain unknown.</p>

								<p>Itâs believed that the <span id="C11" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca people</span>, who predate the <span id="C12" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Incas</span> by as much as 2,000 years, created the lines. Skilled agriculturists, they <span id="C13" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">settled along fertile river valleys fed by water from the <span id="L8" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">Andes</span> around <span id="D3" class="mention date" about="200BC" data-label="200 BC">200 BC</span></span>. Here, they built <span id="C14" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Human Creation">complex irrigation systems and aqueducts, created sophisticated pottery and elaborate textiles</span> and, despite the harsh conditions, flourished for eight centuries.</p>

								<p>During that time they treated the <span id="L9" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">desert</span> as an enormous canvas. <span id="C15" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">Using their hands and rudimentary wooden tools</span>, <span id="C16" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Process">they dug shallow trenches removing the dark stones and top soil to reveal the lighter coloured earth underneath</span>, creating literally <span id="C17" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">hundreds of enormous lines, geometric shapes and recognisable zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures</span>.</p>

								<p>That theyâre still visible today is thanks to <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Nazca</span>âs extreme environment. Itâs one of the <span id="C18" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Extreme Condition">driest places on the planet, with as little as 2mm of rain a year</span>. The <span id="C19" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Process">sun-hardened surface has set the stones in the soil, a rich mixture of clay and gypsum; the harsh wind known as the paracas (âsand rainâ in Quechua) is deflected by the heat rising from the stones, minimising erosion and helping to preserve them intact</span>.</p>

								<h2 class="medium grey distant">Flight of fancy</h2>

								<p>The <span id="C20" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Trace">lines</span> are spread across a <span id="L11" class="mention place" about="Desert" data-label="Peruvian desert" data-wikidata-id="Q8514">500 sq km desert plateau</span> and their sheer size â some of the largest are 200m across â means that they can only be properly seen from the air. As I flew north from the city of <span id="L12" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Nazca</span>, over the vast, arid pampa of <span id="L13" class="mention place" about="Palpa" data-label="Palpa" data-wikidata-id="Q2640020">Palpa</span>, flanked by the <span id="L14" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">long spine of the Andean foothills</span>, stark <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">white lines began to appear</span>. Straight at first, <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">they criss-crossed the ochre and rust-red earth of the desert floor</span>. They soon began to <span id="C21" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Trace">form simple geometric shapes â rectangles, triangles, trapeziums â </span> until I caught sight of the first of the most legendary lines, the <span id="C22" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">menagerie of elaborate birds and animals</span>.</p>

								<p>âComing up on your left, the  <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Ballena</span>,â said the voice in my headphones over the roar of the engine. I scanned the ground trying to pick out the faint form of a killer whale from the muddle. The plane tipped and dipped, left and right.</p>

								<p>â <span id="C23" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Perro [dog]</span>,â the voice said, moments later, and then,  <span id="C24" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">âMonoâ, as the distinctive Nazca monkey</span> with its spiral tail came into view. I was enthralled by the figures â  <span id="C25" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">the elegant Colibri, or hummingbird, and what was clearly a gigantic spider</span>. I twisted from side to side as the lines appeared and disappeared in quick succession, undeterred by the surges of thermal turbulence that had several of my fellow passengers reaching for their sick bags.</p>

								<h2 class="medium grey distant">Lady of the Lines</h2>

								<p>How were the <span id="L15" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> created so precisely? Some continue for kilometres on end. And why? Even their dates are uncertain, estimated from shards of pottery found nearby.</p>

								<p>Peruvian archaeologist <span id="P2" class="mention person" about="ToribioMejÃ­aXesspe" data-label="Toribio MejÃ­a Xesspe">Toribio MejÃ­a Xesspe</span> rediscovered the lines in <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1926">1926</span> but one of the first to comprehensively study them was American geologist <span id="P3" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Paul Kosok</span>. In <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1939">1939</span> <span id="P4" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span> was conducting <span id="C26" class="mention concept" about="interests" data-label="Scientifical Study">studies on ancient irrigation systems</span> when a pilot told him about <span id="L16" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span>. He soon realised that they were <span id="C27" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">too shallow to carry water, so must have another purpose; he assumed it was astronomical after seeing the sun setting exactly over the end of one of the long, single lines at the winter solstice</span>. He christened <span id="L17" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca</span> âthe largest astronomy book in the worldâ.</p>

								<p>Later, <span id="P5" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span>âs assistant, <span id="P6" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Maria Reiche</span>, a German-born teacher and mathematician, found the same effect occurred on the summer solstice. She began to map the lines and discovered <span id="C28" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">18 different kinds of animals and birds</span>. After <span id="P7" class="mention person" about="PaulKosok" data-label="Paul Kosok">Kosok</span> left <span id="L18" class="mention place" about="Peru" data-label="Peru" data-wikidata-id="Q419">Peru</span> in the <span id="D4" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1940">1940s</span>, <span id="P8" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> remained, dedicating her life to unravelling the mystery.</p>

								<p>Her former home near <span id="L19" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca</span>, where sheâs buried, is now a small museum, filled with her <span id="C29" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">yellowing maps, blueprints, measuring tape and rolls of papers</span>. There are <span id="C30" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">photographs of her perched on top of a ladder in the middle of the desert, squinting in the bright sunlight to examine the lines; she even persuaded the <span class="credit"><span id="O1" class="mention organization" about="PAF" data-label="Peruvian Air Force">Peruvian Air Force</span> to help her make aerial photographic surveys</span>.</p>

								<p>Dubbed <span id="C31" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Human Agent">âthe Lady of the Linesâ</span>, she also brought them to the worldâs attention and played a vitally important role in their protection and conservation, educating both the public and the <span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="PeruvianGovernment" data-label="Peruvian Government">Peruvian government</span></span> about their importance. She paid for private security to prevent them from further damage and convinced the government to limit access to the area. In <span id="D5" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1994">1994</span>, four years before her death, the lines were finally declared a <span id="C32" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="World Heritage Site"><span class="credit"><span id="O2" class="mention organization" about="Unesco" data-label="U/nesco">Unesco</span></span> World Heritage Site</span> â though not in time to save the <span id="C33" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">Lizard</span>, which was sliced in two by the Pan-American Highway.</p>

								<p><span id="P9" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> believed <span id="L20" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> were built with <span id="C34" class="mention concept" about="characteristics" data-label="Precision">sophisticated mathematical precision</span>. However, in <span id="D6" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1968">1968</span> the English astronomer <span id="P10" class="mention person" about="GeraldHawkins" data-label="Gerald Hawkins">Gerald Hawkins</span> effectively <span id="C35" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">disproved her theory of astronomical alignment</span>. He specialised in the field of archaeoastronomy and, using the same <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">techniques he applied at <span id="L21" class="mention place" about="Stonehenge" data-label="Stonehenge" data-wikidata-id="Q39671">Stonehenge</span>, found that <span id="L22" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> he studied didnât correspond to any celestial bodies</span>.</p>

								<p>The same year, perhaps the most implausible theory on the lines came from Swiss author, <span id="P11" class="mention person" about="ErichvonDaniken" data-label="Erich von Daniken">Erich von Daniken</span>, who <span id="C36" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Alien theories">suggested in his book, Chariots of the Gods, that they were the runways of an ancient airfield used by extraterrestrial spacecraft</span>. Other researchers believe that <span id="C37" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction"><span id="L23" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> are a precursor of the <span id="C38" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Inca</span> ceques (sacred pathways) that radiate from <span id="L24" class="mention place" about="Cusco" data-label="Cusco" data-wikidata-id="Q205057">Cusco</span></span>, or <span id="C39" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction">a giant map pinpointing underground <span id="C40" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">water supplies</span></span>. <br>
								Because <span id="L25" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span> are best seen from above, there are those who suspected that <span id="C41" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Scientifical Reconstruction"><span id="C42" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span> were capable of flight long before <span id="P12" class="mention person" about="LeonardoDaVinci" data-label="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</span> sketched his <span id="C43" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Craft">flying machines</span></span>. Pottery remains depict what could have been a kite or balloon, so enterprising researchers created a balloon out of materials that would have been available to <span id="C44" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span>; after several attempts, it was airborne for less than 15 minutes.</p>

								<h2 class="medium grey distant">Exalting the elements</h2>

								<p>While most people only view the <span id="L26" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">Nazca lines</span> from the air, to really grasp their scale and the harsh nature of the terrain, you need to see them at close quarters. Before <span id="D7" class="mention date" about="900" data-label="1994">1994</span>, you could drive up to them in your car but now the closest you can get is the <span id="C45" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Building">observation tower</span> that <span id="P13" class="mention person" about="MariaReiche" data-label="Maria Reiche">Reiche</span> helped to sponsor.</p>

								<p>Climbing the rickety metal staircase, I could see how <span id="C46" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Human Creation">the Pan-American Highway had split the barren landscape in half, disappearing into the horizon en route to <span id="L27" class="mention place" about="Chile" data-label="Chile" data-wikidata-id="Q298">Chile</span></span>. The odd lorry rumbled by, but then all was silent save for the whistling wind.</p>

								<p>The <span id="C47" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Natural Wonder">flat, rock-covered plain stretched as far as my eyes could see, only broken up by the occasional dune and the pale lines that, from <span id="C48" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="human Creation">that tower</span>, appeared as wide as a pathway</span>. I looked out in awe over the upside-down <span id="C49" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">figure of the Tree</span> â <span id="C50" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">perhaps the tree of life, or more likely the huarango tree that used to flourish here; with the longest roots of any tree in the world it could reach the deepest water and would bring it back to the surface for other plants</span>.</p>

								<p>Next to it is the figure known as <span id="C51" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">the Hands</span>, one with four fingers, the other with five. According to <span id="P14" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas</span>, itâs more likely a frog or a toad. <span id="P15" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ©</span> is a historian and <span id="C52" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca</span> expert. At 68, heâs spent years studying <span id="L28" class="mention place" about="NazcaLines" data-label="Nazca Lines" data-wikidata-id="Q2620036">the lines</span>, working closely with archaeologists such as the Italian, <span id="P16" class="mention person" about="GiuseppeOrefici" data-label="Giuseppe Orefici">Giuseppe Orefici</span>, whose finds can be seen in the small but fascinating <span id="L10" class="mention place" about="Nasca" data-label="Nasca" data-wikidata-id="Q1711521">Museo DidÃ¡ctico Antonini in Nazca</span>.</p>

								<p>Simply put, <span id="P17" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ©</span> believes that <span id="C53" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">the area is a giant open-air temple, designed for pilgrimage and worship</span>. âYou have to imagine the world of 2,000 years ago,â he told me. â<span id="C54" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca people</span> had simple lives but they were extremely religious. Everyone believed, not in a god they couldnât see, but in the elemental world around them â the sun, moon, stars, wind and water.â</p>

								<p><span id="C55" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Nazca</span>, he told me, came from nanasca, a <span id="C56" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">Quechua</span> word that means pain and suffering â probably coined due to the long periods of drought the people suffered. They were dependent on nature for their survival â <span id="C57" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">water, or lack of it</span>, ruled their lives. âFrom January to March there was water in the river, from April to December they would pray for rain.â</p>

								<p><span id="P18" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ©</span> believes that <span id="C58" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">each clan had a minor god, whose figure was represented on the pampa. Around 80% of the figures consist of just one line; he thinks that these were designed to be walked on, and that the straight lines were roads that would lead the people to their figures</span>.</p>

								<p><span id="C59" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">Their figures were from the world around them: so not an astronaut (a name given by one of the first pilots to fly over it) but a shaman; not a condor but a long-tailed mockingbird</span>. I asked about the monkey and the parrot, both from the Amazon. â<span id="C60" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">They would have traded with the jungle peoples,â JosuÃ© explained</span>.</p>

								<p>On important dates the <span id="C61" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span> would <span id="C62" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">carry out ceremonies on the lines as an offering to the gods in the sky to secure a flow of water from the <span id="L29" class="mention place" about="Andes" data-label="Andes" data-wikidata-id="Q5456">Andes</span></span>. â<span id="C63" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Historical Reconstruction">Around October, they would check the cloud formations in the mountains and, if by the December solstice there was no rain, there would be human sacrifices to appease the gods and ensure their good will</span>,â <span id="P19" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ©</span> told me. This theory is borne out by the mummified, severed heads in the <span id="L30" class="mention place" about="Ica" data-label="Ica Museum" data-wikidata-id="Q208186">Ica Regional Museum</span>. They have hair (again, thanks to the preserving desert climate) and a rope threaded though a hole in the skull, presumably to help people carry them.</p>

								<p><span id="P20" class="mention person" about="JosuÃ©LanchoRojas" data-label="JosuÃ© Lancho Rojas">JosuÃ©</span> doesnât believe they were exceptional mathematicians and astronomers, although that theory appeals to nationalistic pride; <span id="C64" class="mention concept" about="tools" data-label="Resource">they were, he reckons, just a society in which everyone developed a skill and had a part to play</span>. Their knowledge of weaving, for example, helped them to translate the images on to the vast canvas of the pampa. And as for the alien theory, he simply rolled his eyes.</p>

								<h2 class="medium grey distant">Enigmatic to the end</h2>

								<p><span id="C65" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">In a flurry of dust, I crunched across the stony, unforgiving ground, the setting sun casting my shadow over the parched earth. From my vantage point on top of a small hill by the highway, <span id="C66" class="mention concept" about="sights" data-label="Image">lines and geometric markings were spread out in all their elemental glory</span>. It became clear how inextricably linked they are â how linked <span id="C67" class="mention concept" about="agents" data-label="Population">the Nazca</span> were â to this austere environment</span>. </p>

								<p>New lines are being found, new theories abound and new technological research is sure to increase our knowledge. But <span id="C68" class="mention concept" about="stories" data-label="Personal Experience">looking out over the ambiguous markings, it was thrilling to think that, in this world of information overload, there are still things that may never be completely understood</span>.</p>
